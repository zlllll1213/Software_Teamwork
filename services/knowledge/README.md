# Knowledge Service

Knowledge owns knowledge-base metadata, knowledge document metadata/status,
processing trace state, and future chunk/vector lifecycle coordination.

This implementation includes the A-09 foundation slice, the A-10 document
upload handoff, and the A-11 ingestion worker path: Knowledge accepts the
document upload, stores raw bytes through File Service, creates durable
document/job state, enqueues ingestion work, then consumes the A10 task payload
to read source bytes, parse, chunk, embed, and index chunks.

## Runtime

- Go module: `go 1.25.0`
- HTTP: standard `net/http` `ServeMux`
- Logging: `log/slog`
- PostgreSQL access: `pgx` + generated `sqlc` query package
- Migrations: `goose`

All landed Go services use the repository Go 1.25 baseline. Knowledge keeps the
standard `net/http` / `http.ServeMux` service shape while leaving room for later
RAG MCP server work.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | - | PostgreSQL connection string. |
| `FILE_SERVICE_BASE_URL` | yes | - | Internal File Service base URL for `/internal/v1/files`. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_REDIS_ADDR` | yes | - | Redis/asynq endpoint for ingestion task handoff. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_HTTP_ADDR` | no | `:8083` | HTTP listen address. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_VERSION` | no | `dev` | Version returned by readiness checks. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_ENV` | no | `local` | Runtime environment label. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | no | `33554432` | Multipart upload limit in bytes. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_TOKEN` | yes | - | Internal service token forwarded to File Service. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | no | `10s` | Graceful shutdown timeout. |
| `OCR_SERVICE_BASE_URL` | no | - | Optional OCR service base URL for PDF/image text extraction. |
| `OCR_SERVICE_TOKEN` | no | - | Optional OCR service token. |
| `OCR_SERVICE_TIMEOUT` | no | `30s` | OCR request timeout. |
| `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | no | `local_hashing` | Embedding provider; `ai_gateway` uses AI Gateway. |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | no | `local_hashing` | Embedding model/profile label. |
| `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` | no | `384` | Embedding vector dimension. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` | no | - | AI Gateway base URL when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ai_gateway`. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_SERVICE_TOKEN` | no | - | Optional AI Gateway service token. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_EMBEDDING_PROFILE_ID` | no | - | Optional AI Gateway embedding profile ID. |
| `QDRANT_URL` | no | - | Optional Qdrant REST base URL; unset uses in-memory index. |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | no | - | Optional Qdrant API key. |
| `QDRANT_COLLECTION` | no | `knowledge_chunks` | Qdrant collection name. |

When `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ai_gateway`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL` must match the resolved AI Gateway embedding profile `model`. If `AI_GATEWAY_EMBEDDING_PROFILE_ID` is unset, AI Gateway uses its default enabled embedding profile and still validates the `model` value before calling the provider.

## Implemented Routes

Operational routes:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`

Internal service routes:

- `GET /internal/v1/knowledge-bases`
- `POST /internal/v1/knowledge-bases`
- `GET /internal/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}`
- `PATCH /internal/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}`
- `DELETE /internal/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}`
- `GET /internal/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}/documents`
- `POST /internal/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}/documents`
- `GET /internal/v1/documents/{documentId}`

Public gateway equivalents are documented in
`docs/services/gateway/api/openapi.yaml`.

## Access Context

Business routes require gateway-injected `X-User-Id`.

Supported permission strings follow the current auth docs:

- `knowledge:read`
- `knowledge:write`

Rules:

- Callers can read resources they created.
- `knowledge:read`, `knowledge:write`, `admin`, or `super_admin` can read
  broader resources.
- Create, update, and delete require `knowledge:write`, `admin`, or
  `super_admin`.
- Hidden or deleted resources return `404 not_found`.
- Authenticated callers without mutation rights receive `403 forbidden`.

## Data Model

The first migration creates:

- `knowledge_bases`
- `knowledge_documents`
- `processing_jobs`
- `document_chunks`

Document upload stores the File Service object ID only in
`knowledge_documents.file_ref`. Public document responses expose `jobId` and
document status, but never `fileRef`, File Service internal IDs, object keys, or
internal URLs.

`document_chunks` is now written by the ingestion worker. Qdrant payloads are
limited to `knowledge_base_id`, `document_id`, `chunk_id`, `chunk_index`,
`chunk_type`, `section_path`, `tags`, and `metadata`. Retrieval execution and
gateway chunk/query routes remain separate follow-up work.

Knowledge base deletion is soft-delete-first:

- mark `knowledge_bases.deleted_at`;
- mark owned `knowledge_documents.deleted_at` in the same transaction for the
  PostgreSQL runtime repository;
- leave chunk/index cleanup for a future lifecycle job instead of hard-deleting
  chunks or vectors in this metadata route.


## Migrations

Apply the service-owned migration with the project-pinned `goose@v3.27.1` command:

```bash
go run github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@v3.27.1 -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up
```
## Development

```bash
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/server
```

Regenerate the query package from `sqlc.yaml` after changing SQL files:

```bash
go run github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@v1.29.0 generate
```
