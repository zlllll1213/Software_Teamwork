# PR 350 review fixes

## Goal

Address PR #350 review feedback for issue #102 without expanding feature scope:
close the section-version transaction race, align Gateway OpenAPI section-version
schemas with Document, and remove machine-specific validation paths from the PR
description.

## Requirements

- R1: Re-check the target section state inside the same transaction that creates a
  section version and switches the current section, so a concurrent transition to
  `generation_status = running` cannot be overwritten by stale pre-transaction
  data.
- R2: Preserve the existing report/section ownership checks and continue to reject
  running sections with `409 conflict`.
- R3: Update Gateway public OpenAPI section-version schemas to include the same
  `content`, `tables`, `source: manual|ai`, and required fields as Document.
- R4: Keep the PR description validation commands free of machine-specific local
  paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Service tests cover a section becoming `running` inside `CreateSectionVersion`
  transaction and assert no historical version/current switch is persisted.
- [x] Existing section-version, generation, HTTP, and Document service checks pass
  after the fix.
- [x] Document and Gateway public OpenAPI section-version request/response schemas
  remain aligned.
- [x] PR body on GitHub uses generic `go` commands instead of local absolute
  Go binary paths.

## Notes

- Review comments came from the PR #350 review bot: one P1 race in
  `CreateSectionVersion`, one P2 Gateway OpenAPI schema mismatch.
