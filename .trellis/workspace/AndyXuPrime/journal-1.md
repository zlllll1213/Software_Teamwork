## Session 1: Integrate report generation frontend module

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Task**: Integrate report generation frontend module
**Branch**: `PrimeTeam/feat/report-generation-frontend-integration`

### Summary

Integrated the report generation module into the existing frontend, verified the app with Bun checks, and opened PR #140 to upstream develop.

### Main Changes

- Reviewed the existing frontend progress in `apps/web` and the gateway OpenAPI contract for report generation.
- Generated browser-facing gateway OpenAPI types from `docs/services/gateway/api/openapi.yaml` into `apps/web/src/api/generated/gateway.ts`.
- Added gateway envelope helpers in `apps/web/src/api/client.ts` for normal JSON, paginated JSON, and file download responses.
- Added the report generation frontend API layer, TanStack Query hooks, schemas, and shared report types under `apps/web/src/features/reports/`.
- Added route-level pages for report generation, report records, and report templates under `apps/web/src/pages/reports/`.
- Wired `/reports/generate`, `/reports/records`, and `/reports/templates` into the TanStack Router and added report navigation entries to the app layout and admin sidebar.
- Updated the external standalone HTML prototype to align visible API labels and payload naming with the latest gateway contract; this file is outside the repository and was not committed.
- Installed Bun globally for local frontend verification and stopped the previously running Vite dev server.
- Created PR #140 from the personal fork branch into upstream `develop`.

### Pull Request

- https://github.com/Sakayori-Iroha-168/Software_Teamwork/pull/140

### Testing

- [OK] `bun run --cwd apps/web check`
- [OK] `bun run --cwd apps/web build`
- [OK] `git diff --check` passed with Windows LF/CRLF warnings only

### Status

[OK] **Completed**

### Next Steps

- Wait for reviewer feedback and CI on PR #140.
- If maintainers require Trellis task artifacts for this implementation, add a lightweight archived task record that references the same work and PR.
- Consider future frontend code splitting if the Vite large chunk warning becomes a CI or performance concern.


## Session 2: Fix frontend RBAC route guards for PR 212

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Task**: Fix frontend RBAC route guards for PR 212
**Branch**: `fix/frontend-post-206-polish`

### Summary

Implemented Gateway-backed frontend auth shell and RBAC navigation, then fixed PR #212 review findings by tightening /admin, report generation, report template, explicit-permission, QA admin seed-aligned, and report record write-action checks. Updated PR body and pushed the fork branch without merging. Validation passed: bun run --cwd apps/web check, bun run --cwd apps/web build, and git diff --check.

### Main Changes

- Added Gateway-backed frontend auth flow, session restore, authenticated shell, forbidden state, RBAC route guards, and permission-filtered top/admin navigation for PR #212.
- Fixed `/admin` default routing so non-`system:admin` users are redirected to the first management page they can access instead of rendering QA statistics.
- Tightened report routes so `/reports/generate` requires report write permission while read-only users entering `/reports` land on report records.
- Tightened report template access so `/reports/templates`, `/admin/reports/templates`, and the admin sidebar template entry require report write permission because the page exposes template save/delete actions.
- Removed the frontend-only admin role name global bypass from `canAccess()` so route and menu guards honor explicit `UserSummary.permissions[]` grants from the auth/gateway contract.
- Replaced the nonexistent `qa:write` frontend guards with seeded admin management permissions (`admin:model-profile:write`, `admin:parser-config:write`) plus `system:admin` for QA configuration, retrieval test, and prompt management routes/menus.
- Hid report record write actions for read-only users by checking report write permission before rendering the “new report” entry and delete controls.
- Updated PR #212 body to the repository template style with Chinese summary, `Closes #109`, validation commands, and known risks.
- Pushed the fixes to the personal fork branch without merging the upstream PR.

## Session 3: Finish PR 212 permission redirect review

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Task**: Finish PR 212 permission redirect review
**Branch**: `fix/frontend-post-206-polish`

### Summary

Fixed the remaining PR #212 permission-navigation dead ends by routing login, forbidden, root, and admin back links through permission-aware home selection; local frontend checks passed.

### Main Changes

- Changed login success, authenticated root, the Forbidden page action, and the admin back link to route through `/`.
- Added permission-aware app-home routing so QA users land on `/chat`, report writers on `/reports/generate`, report readers on `/reports/records`, and admin-only users on `/admin`.
- Kept `/chat` reachable only through the existing `qa:use` route/menu guard.

## Session 4: Fix PR 212 knowledge admin permissions

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Task**: Fix PR 212 knowledge admin permissions
**Branch**: `fix/frontend-post-206-polish`

### Summary

Resolved the latest Codex PR Review finding by requiring knowledge:write for the knowledge management route/menu and redirecting read-only knowledge users to the read-only knowledge configuration page; frontend checks passed.

### Main Changes

- Required `knowledge:write` for `/admin/knowledge` and the matching admin sidebar item because the page exposes create, edit, and delete mutations.
- Kept read-only knowledge users on view-oriented admin pages by routing `/admin` to `/admin/knowledge-config` when they have knowledge access but not write access.
- Verified the permission names against the auth seed permissions.

## Session 5: Fix PR 212 read-only report navigation

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Task**: Fix PR 212 read-only report navigation
**Branch**: `fix/frontend-report-read-nav`

### Summary

Resolved the latest Codex PR Review finding by exposing the top report navigation to report:read users and routing it through /reports so existing route guards send write users to generation and read-only users to records; frontend checks passed.

### Main Changes

- Changed the top-level report navigation target from `/reports/generate` to `/reports`.
- Expanded the report nav visibility requirement to include `report:read`.
- Reused the existing `/reports` index redirect so write users reach generation and read-only users reach records.

## Session 7: Finish issue 116 shared UI states

**Date**: 2026-06-30
**Task**: Finish issue 116 shared UI states
**Branch**: `Frontend/refactor/shared-ui-states`

### Summary

Implemented and verified shared frontend state UI for issue #116.

### Main Changes

﻿- Added shared common UI state primitives for `StateBlock`, `InlineNotice`, `ConfirmDialog`, `ProgressSummary`, and `TableSkeleton`.
- Reused the shared state components across knowledge documents/search, QA chat/sidebar, and report generate/records surfaces for loading, empty, error, progress, warning, and destructive confirmation states.
- Captured the frontend shared-state component convention in `.trellis/spec/frontend/component-guidelines.md`.
- Verified against latest `upstream/develop`; `git rev-list --left-right --count upstream/develop...HEAD` was clean before committing.
- Validation passed: `bun run --cwd apps/web check`, `bun run --cwd apps/web build`, and `git diff --check`.
