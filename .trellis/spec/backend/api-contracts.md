# API Contracts

> Contract-first rules for gateway-facing and cross-service HTTP APIs.

---

## Scenario: Gateway Contract-First API

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: any new or changed frontend-facing gateway endpoint, gateway
  response envelope, frontend API client DTO, or cross-service route ownership.
- Applies to `services/gateway/`, browser API clients under `apps/frontend/`,
  and the domain service that owns the endpoint's business state.

### 2. Signatures

Gateway public endpoints are documented in:

```text
docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml
```

Public routes use these prefixes:

```text
GET /healthz
GET /readyz
/api/v1/**
```

Stable public gateway routes and service-to-service HTTP routes must be
RESTful resource-oriented APIs:

- model paths as resources or collections,
- use HTTP methods for actions,
- use `GET` for reads, `POST` for creation, `PATCH` for partial updates, and
  `DELETE` for deletion,
- do not put action verbs such as `login`, `logout`, `register`, `download`,
  `search`, `generate`, `export`, `retry`, or `revoke` in stable paths,
- model long-running work as resources such as `jobs`, `files`, `sessions`,
  `messages`, `events`, or `queries`.

`/healthz` and `/readyz` are allowed operational exceptions.

Every OpenAPI operation must include:

- `operationId`
- `tags`
- `summary`
- at least one success response
- at least one `4XX` response for user-callable operations
- `x-owner-service` for routes backed by a service boundary

### 3. Contracts

Gateway success envelope:

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "requestId": "req_123"
}
```

Gateway paginated envelope:

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "page": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 20,
    "total": 100
  },
  "requestId": "req_123"
}
```

Gateway error envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "request validation failed",
    "requestId": "req_123",
    "fields": {
      "name": "is required"
    }
  }
}
```

Public IDs are strings. Public timestamps use OpenAPI `date-time`.

Gateway must pass request context to downstream services with these headers
when values are available:

| Header | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Request-Id` | Correlate frontend request, gateway logs, and downstream logs. |
| `X-User-Id` | Authenticated user identity. |
| `X-User-Roles` | Comma-separated authenticated roles. |
| `X-User-Permissions` | Comma-separated authenticated permissions. |
| `X-Forwarded-For` | Original client address chain. |
| `X-Forwarded-Proto` | Original request protocol. |

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Public response |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid request shape or field value | `400 validation_error` |
| Missing or invalid authentication | `401 unauthorized` |
| Authenticated caller lacks permission | `403 forbidden` |
| Resource does not exist or is hidden | `404 not_found` |
| State conflict | `409 conflict` |
| Rate or quota exceeded | `429 rate_limited` |
| Downstream service or infrastructure failed | `502 dependency_error` |
| Unexpected gateway failure | `500 internal_error` |

Do not forward raw downstream error bodies, SQL details, object keys, tokens,
prompts, vector payloads, or internal URLs to the frontend.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: add a gateway route to `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`, mark
  `x-owner-service`, use the standard envelope, and update
  `docs/service-boundaries.md` if ownership is new.
- Base: proxy a domain-service route through gateway without changing the
  domain response shape, but still normalize errors to the gateway envelope.
- Bad: add a frontend call directly to `services/knowledge` or embed Qdrant,
  MinIO, SQL, prompt, or report-generation logic in gateway.

### 6. Tests Required

When implementation exists:

- Gateway handler tests assert status code, response envelope, and request id.
- Error tests cover validation, auth failure, forbidden, not found, and
  dependency failure where applicable.
- Cross-service client tests use mocked HTTP servers and assert propagated
  context headers.
- Frontend API client tests assert request path, response normalization, and
  error-code mapping.

For documentation-only contract changes:

- Run an OpenAPI linter against `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`.
- Parse the YAML and verify `$ref` targets resolve.
- Check route prefix consistency: health routes stay unversioned, public API
  routes use `/api/v1/**`.
- Check stable and placeholder paths follow the RESTful resource-path rule.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
frontend -> services/knowledge/search
gateway handler -> Qdrant query -> raw vector payload response
```

#### Correct

```text
frontend -> gateway /api/v1/knowledge-queries
gateway -> knowledge service
knowledge service -> retrieval infrastructure
gateway -> normalized KnowledgeQueryResponse or ErrorResponse
```

## Scenario: Internal Service Contract API

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing an internal service-to-service HTTP API, including
  model invocation APIs owned by `ai-gateway`.
- Applies to `docs/接口契约/openapi/<service>.openapi.yaml`,
  `services/<service>/api/openapi.yaml`, service interface docs, and matching
  service-boundary documentation.

### 2. Signatures

Internal service routes use:

```text
GET /healthz
GET /readyz
/internal/v1/**
```

AI Gateway model invocation routes intentionally use OpenAI-compatible paths
inside the internal prefix:

```text
POST /internal/v1/chat/completions
POST /internal/v1/embeddings
POST /internal/v1/rerankings
```

`/internal/v1/rerankings` is an OpenAI-style extension because OpenAI does not
define a native rerank endpoint.

### 3. Contracts

Internal project-owned configuration or metadata APIs use the standard project
envelope:

```json
{ "data": {}, "requestId": "req_123" }
```

```json
{ "error": { "code": "validation_error", "message": "request validation failed", "requestId": "req_123" } }
```

AI Gateway chat completion and embedding APIs use OpenAI-compatible request,
success response, streaming chunk, and error body shapes. They must not wrap
successful model responses in the project `data/requestId` envelope. The
request id is carried through `X-Request-Id` response headers and logs.

Internal services must accept or propagate these headers when available:

| Header | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Request-Id` | Correlate public gateway, domain service, AI Gateway, and provider logs. |
| `X-Service-Token` | Authenticate service-to-service calls. |
| `X-Caller-Service` | Identify the calling service, such as `qa`, `knowledge`, or `document`. |
| `X-User-Id` | Audit the user that triggered the model call when applicable. |
| `X-User-Roles` | Audit or quota context. |
| `X-User-Permissions` | Audit or quota context. |

Internal responses and logs must not expose raw API keys, provider bearer
tokens, prompt secrets, raw provider error bodies, storage object keys, vector
payloads, SQL details, or internal URLs.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Internal response |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid request shape or field value | `400 validation_error` or OpenAI-style `invalid_request_error` |
| Missing or invalid service credential | `401 unauthorized` or OpenAI-style `authentication_error` |
| Caller service lacks permission | `403 forbidden` or OpenAI-style `permission_error` |
| Profile or resource does not exist | `404 not_found` |
| State or configuration conflict | `409 conflict` |
| Rate or quota exceeded | `429 rate_limited` or OpenAI-style `rate_limit_error` |
| Provider or infrastructure failed | `502 dependency_error` or OpenAI-style `upstream_error` |
| Unexpected service failure | `500 internal_error` |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `qa` calls `ai-gateway` with `POST /internal/v1/chat/completions`,
  keeps conversation/message/citation state in `qa`, and stores only the
  normalized assistant response.
- Base: `knowledge` calls `POST /internal/v1/embeddings` and writes the returned
  vectors to its own Qdrant collections without exposing vector payloads to
  gateway responses.
- Bad: public `gateway` directly calls an OpenAI-compatible provider, stores an
  API key, or exposes `/internal/v1/chat/completions` to frontend clients.

### 6. Tests Required

For documentation-only contract changes:

- Parse the affected OpenAPI YAML file.
- Verify all `$ref` targets resolve.
- Verify internal business paths use `/internal/v1/**`, except `/healthz` and
  `/readyz`.
- Verify AI Gateway model invocation operations document OpenAI-compatible
  success and error shapes.
- Check Markdown links resolve.

When implementation exists:

- Handler tests assert project envelope or OpenAI-compatible response shape as
  appropriate for the endpoint.
- Cross-service client tests assert `X-Request-Id`, `X-Service-Token`, and
  `X-Caller-Service` propagation.
- Sensitive-data tests assert API keys, provider tokens, prompts, raw provider
  errors, and vector payloads are not logged or returned.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
frontend -> gateway -> /internal/v1/chat/completions
gateway stores provider API key and streams raw provider chunks
```

#### Correct

```text
frontend -> gateway /api/v1/qa-sessions/{sessionId}/messages
gateway -> qa service
qa service -> ai-gateway /internal/v1/chat/completions
qa owns messages, citations, and public SSE event shape
```

## Scenario: Missing Downstream API Contracts

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: a downstream service such as `knowledge`, `qa`, `document`, or an
  aggregation surface has not finalized its frontend/backend contract yet.
- Applies to `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`, `docs/gateway.md`,
  `docs/service-boundaries.md`, and `docs/frontend-backend-contract.md`.

### 2. Signatures

Unfinalized endpoints must not be added as active `paths` operations in:

```text
docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml
```

Instead, list them under the OpenAPI root extension:

```yaml
x-missing-contracts:
  - service: knowledge
    status: missing
    reason: Frontend/backend contract is not finalized yet.
    placeholderOperations:
      - GET /api/v1/knowledge-bases
```

### 3. Contracts

Active OpenAPI `paths` represent stable frontend-facing contracts. Missing
placeholder operations are TODO markers only:

- frontend clients must not generate callable methods from placeholders,
- backend services must not treat placeholders as implementation commitments,
- docs may describe expected ownership, but not stable request/response fields.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint request/response shape is finalized | Add an active OpenAPI operation with owner, schemas, and error responses. |
| Endpoint owner is known but shape is not finalized | Keep it in `x-missing-contracts` only. |
| Placeholder overlaps with an active operation | Use method-level placeholders, not broad path globs that hide stable operations. |
| Frontend needs a missing endpoint | First finalize and review the OpenAPI operation, then generate or implement clients. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: keep `POST /api/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}/documents` active
  for file upload, while marking `GET /api/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}/documents`
  missing for the future knowledge-owned list contract.
- Base: mention future `qa` routes in prose and mark resource paths such as
  `/api/v1/qa-sessions/{sessionId}/messages` missing until message and SSE
  event shapes are agreed.
- Bad: add full `knowledge`, `qa`, or `document` schemas to OpenAPI as if they
  were stable just to reserve routes.

### 6. Tests Required

For documentation-only contract changes:

- Parse `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`.
- Verify every active `/api/v1/**` operation has an allowed finalized owner.
- Verify missing downstream areas are present in `x-missing-contracts`.
- Check broad placeholders do not contradict active operations.
- Check Markdown links resolve.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
OpenAPI paths include POST /api/v1/qa-sessions/{sessionId}/messages:stream
even though QA message and SSE event contracts are not agreed.
```

#### Correct

```text
x-missing-contracts lists resource placeholders such as
GET /api/v1/qa-sessions/{sessionId}/events as missing until the QA contract is finalized.
```

## Scenario: Domain Service Interface Documents

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing a service-level interface document such as
  `docs/auth.md` or `docs/file.md`.
- Applies when gateway-facing routes depend on an internal domain service
  contract, even if the service code has not been implemented yet.

### 2. Signatures

Service interface documents must list every related gateway route with:

- HTTP method
- gateway path
- authentication requirement
- owner service
- short behavior summary

If an internal service route is proposed, mark it as an internal draft and keep
it separate from the public gateway contract.

### 3. Contracts

Document request and response fields using the same public IDs, timestamps,
envelopes, and error shapes defined in `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`.
Binary success responses, such as file content, may omit the JSON envelope,
but error responses must still use the standard error shape.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

For each documented endpoint, separate:

- status codes already declared in OpenAPI,
- future status codes that require an OpenAPI update before frontend reliance.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `docs/file.md` documents file-owned routes, notes knowledge-owned
  related routes, and calls out that object keys must not reach the frontend.
- Base: a service document summarizes the gateway OpenAPI without adding
  implementation-only behavior.
- Bad: a service document declares a new frontend-facing status code or field
  as stable without updating `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`.

### 6. Tests Required

For documentation-only changes:

- Parse `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`.
- Verify documented public paths exist in the OpenAPI file.
- Check Markdown links resolve.

When implementation exists, add handler or client tests for the documented
status codes, envelopes, request id propagation, and context headers.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
docs/file.md declares GET /api/v1/files/{id}/download as stable
gateway.openapi.yaml has no matching public path
```

#### Correct

```text
docs/file.md references /api/v1/documents/{documentId}/content
gateway.openapi.yaml owns the same public path and owner-service marker
```

## Scenario: Internal Domain Service APIs

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: implementing a domain service HTTP API that gateway or another backend
  service will call directly, even when the public gateway contract is unchanged.
- Applies to `services/<service>/api/openapi.yaml`, `services/<service>/internal/http/`,
  service README files, and matching domain docs such as `docs/file.md`.

### 2. Signatures

Internal domain-service routes must use service-local versioned resource paths:

```text
GET /healthz
GET /readyz
/internal/v1/**
```

Business routes under `/internal/v1/**` must remain RESTful and resource-oriented.
They may be close to public gateway paths, but they are not public frontend
contracts unless the same operation is active in `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`.

### 3. Contracts

Every implemented domain service should document internal API signatures in:

```text
services/<service>/api/openapi.yaml
```

Internal JSON responses use the same envelope and error shapes as gateway:

```json
{ "data": {}, "requestId": "req_123" }
```

```json
{ "error": { "code": "validation_error", "message": "request validation failed", "requestId": "req_123" } }
```

Internal metadata responses may include service-owned integration fields that
are not yet public frontend fields, for example `contentType` or `sizeBytes`
for file-owned metadata. They must not expose storage object keys, bucket names,
internal URLs, SQL details, tokens, credentials, vector payloads, or prompts.

Domain services must accept gateway context headers when present:

| Header | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Request-Id` | Correlate gateway, service logs, and downstream calls. |
| `X-User-Id` | Authenticated user identity injected by gateway. |
| `X-User-Roles` | Comma-separated roles injected by gateway. |
| `X-User-Permissions` | Comma-separated permissions injected by gateway. |
| `X-Forwarded-For` | Original client address chain. |
| `X-Forwarded-Proto` | Original request protocol. |

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Internal response |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid request shape or field value | `400 validation_error` |
| Missing required gateway user context | `401 unauthorized` |
| Authenticated caller lacks permission | `403 forbidden` |
| Resource does not exist, is deleted, or should be hidden | `404 not_found` |
| State conflict | `409 conflict` |
| Infrastructure dependency failed | `502 dependency_error` |
| Unexpected service failure | `500 internal_error` |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: file service adds `GET /internal/v1/documents/{documentId}` for
  file-owned metadata and documents it in `services/file/api/openapi.yaml`,
  while public `GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId}` remains a knowledge-owned
  missing contract.
- Base: gateway proxies an active public route to a matching internal route and
  normalizes any service-owned extra fields before returning to frontend.
- Bad: a domain service adds a public-looking `/api/v1/**` route or exposes raw
  object keys, bucket names, MinIO URLs, SQL errors, prompts, or vector payloads
  in an internal response body.

### 6. Tests Required

When implementation exists:

- Handler tests assert envelope shape, request id propagation, and expected
  status codes for validation, auth context failure, not found, and dependency
  failures where applicable.
- DTO or handler tests assert service-owned integration fields are returned only
  by internal contracts when they are not public gateway fields.
- Content or streaming endpoints assert binary success responses and JSON error
  responses separately.
- Cross-service client tests assert gateway context headers are propagated.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
services/file exposes GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId}
response includes objectKey: documents/doc_123
```

#### Correct

```text
services/file exposes GET /internal/v1/documents/{documentId}
response includes contentType and sizeBytes, but no objectKey
public GET /api/v1/documents/{documentId} stays missing until knowledge contract is finalized
```
## Scenario: Gateway Redis Session Cache

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing user creation, session creation, current session
  deletion, current-user behavior, auth middleware, or session identity fields.
- Applies to `services/gateway/`, `services/auth/`, `docs/auth.md`,
  `docs/gateway.md`, `docs/frontend-backend-contract.md`, and
  `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`.

### 2. Signatures

Public auth routes stay under:

```text
POST /api/v1/users
POST /api/v1/sessions
DELETE /api/v1/sessions/current
GET  /api/v1/users/me
```

Auth success responses must include `data.user` and `data.session`.

### 3. Contracts

`data.user` must include:

- `id`
- `username`
- `roles`
- `permissions`

`data.session` must include:

- `sessionId`
- `accessToken`
- `tokenType`
- `expiresAt`

Gateway must store the runtime session in Redis using:

```text
gateway:session:<accessTokenHash>
```

The cached value must include enough fields to inject `X-User-Id`,
`X-User-Roles`, and `X-User-Permissions` without calling auth on every
business request. The Redis TTL must not outlive `data.session.expiresAt`.
Redis is not the durable source of user, role, permission, or session truth.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Public response |
| --- | --- |
| Missing bearer credential | `401 unauthorized` |
| Redis session miss, expired session, or malformed cache value | `401 unauthorized` |
| Auth rejects session credentials | `401 unauthorized` |
| Gateway cannot access Redis for an authenticated business request | `502 dependency_error` |
| Auth service or durable auth store is unavailable during user/session operations | `502 dependency_error` |

Do not expose raw tokens, token hashes, Redis keys, session secrets, or auth
internal URLs to frontend responses or logs.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: session creation response returns `user` plus `session`; gateway hashes the access
  token for the Redis key, sets TTL from `expiresAt`, and injects downstream
  identity headers from the cache.
- Base: `/api/v1/users/me` reads the Redis session cache and returns `UserResponse`
  without calling auth for every request.
- Bad: gateway stores original access tokens in logs or treats Redis as the
  durable source of permissions.

### 6. Tests Required

When implementation exists:

- Auth handler/client tests assert `SessionResponse` includes `user.permissions`
  and `session`.
- Gateway auth middleware tests cover Redis hit, miss, expired session,
  malformed session, and Redis dependency failure.
- Gateway downstream client tests assert `X-User-Id`, `X-User-Roles`,
  `X-User-Permissions`, and `X-Request-Id` are propagated.
- Current-session deletion tests assert auth invalidation is called and Redis cache is deleted.

For documentation-only changes:

- Parse `docs/api/gateway.openapi.yaml`.
- Verify `SessionResponse` requires `user` and `session`.
- Verify docs mention `gateway:session:<accessTokenHash>` and Redis TTL.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
gateway receives Authorization: Bearer token
gateway calls auth service on every business request
gateway logs the raw token on failures
```

#### Correct

```text
gateway receives Authorization: Bearer token
gateway hashes token and reads gateway:session:<accessTokenHash>
gateway injects cached user, roles, and permissions into downstream headers
```
