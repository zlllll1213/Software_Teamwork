# Database Guidelines

> Database, cache, vector-search, and object-storage conventions for Go backend services.

---

## Overview

Each backend service owns its persistence concerns. A service may use
PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, or MinIO only through service-local repository or
platform packages. Handlers must not talk directly to infrastructure clients.

Confirmed Go infrastructure target stack:

- PostgreSQL: `pgx` + `sqlc`.
- Migrations: `goose@v3.27.1`.
- Redis cache/session access: `go-redis`.
- Redis queues: `asynq v0.26.0`.
- Qdrant: a short-term hand-written HTTP client until usage justifies an official or generated client.
- Object storage: File Service owns an `ObjectStore` port. Production target is
  MinIO or an equivalent persistent object-store adapter; the MinIO adapter is
  implemented behind the same port.

Current repository facts from `docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md`:

- Auth, Knowledge, QA, Document, File, and AI Gateway use `pgx/v5@v5.9.2`.
  New PostgreSQL services should reuse that major version and must not
  reintroduce `pgx/v4` or a third pgx major version without updating the
  technology baseline.
- The repository-wide recommended `sqlc` CLI version is `v1.31.1`. Regenerate
  service query packages with
  `go run github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@v1.31.1 generate`; do not use an
  unpinned `sqlc generate` command in docs, CI, or handoff notes.
- Gateway directly uses `go-redis/v9@v9.21.0`; Knowledge indirectly uses
  `go-redis/v9@v9.14.1` through asynq. Aligning Redis client versions is a
  follow-up decision, not an implementation-PR side effect.
- Knowledge and Document have fixed `asynq v0.26.0`; new asynchronous jobs
  should reuse that version unless a documented decision upgrades it.
- File Service runtime has memory/local/MinIO object-store adapters, a
  PostgreSQL metadata repository, migrations, and service-token validation.
  `FILE_DATABASE_URL` being empty is a local/test fallback, not the production
  persistence baseline.
- Knowledge owns Qdrant vector persistence and retrieval hydration. Keep
  Qdrant as a Knowledge boundary and treat missing real-dependency smoke as a
  validation gap, not permission for QA, Gateway, or AI Gateway to mutate
  Qdrant directly.

Do not introduce an ORM by default. If a service needs one, document the reason
in that service README, update `docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md`,
and then update this spec.

---

## PostgreSQL Ownership

- Each service owns the tables it writes.
- Do not let one service write another service's tables.
- Cross-service data needs should go through HTTP APIs, events, or explicit read-model decisions.
- Table schemas must be represented by migrations under `services/<service>/migrations/`.
- Services that use PostgreSQL must keep service-local `sqlc.yaml`, query files,
  generated `sqlc` code, and `goose` migrations. Generated query structs must
  not leak into HTTP handlers.

Use PostgreSQL for:

- user identities, roles, permissions, sessions, and tokens metadata,
- file metadata and processing states,
- knowledge metadata and ingestion status,
- document generation jobs and outputs metadata,
- audit-friendly business state.

---

## Query Patterns

- Use parameterized queries only. Never concatenate user input into SQL.
- Keep SQL in repository methods or dedicated query files.
- Keep repository methods small and named by intent, not by SQL operation.
- Return domain-oriented structs from repositories; do not leak raw DB rows into handlers.
- Pass `context.Context` through every database call.
- Use pagination for list endpoints.
- Use explicit column lists instead of `SELECT *`.

Example repository shape:

```go
type UserRepository struct {
    db *pgxpool.Pool
}

func (r *UserRepository) FindByID(ctx context.Context, id UserID) (User, error) {
    const query = `
        SELECT id, email, display_name, created_at
        FROM users
        WHERE id = $1
    `
    // scan and wrap errors here
}
```

---

## Transactions

- Start transactions at the service/use-case layer when one business operation changes multiple records.
- Keep transaction bodies short and deterministic.
- Pass transaction handles into repositories through explicit interfaces.
- Roll back on every error and wrap rollback failures only when they add useful context.
- Do not perform slow external calls while holding a PostgreSQL transaction.

## Scenario: PostgreSQL pgx v5 Service Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding a PostgreSQL-backed Go service, changing a service's pgx/sqlc
  dependency, regenerating sqlc code, or touching repository pool/transaction
  wiring.
- Applies to `services/<service>/go.mod`, `services/<service>/sqlc.yaml`,
  `services/<service>/internal/repository/**`, generated sqlc code, service
  startup wiring, and service implementation docs.

### 2. Signatures

- Module dependency: `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5 v5.9.2`.
- sqlc config: `sql_package: "pgx/v5"`.
- sqlc generation command:
  `go run github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@v1.31.1 generate`.
- Pool import: `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool`.
- Pool constructor: `pgxpool.New(ctx, databaseURL)`.
- Startup reachability check: `pool.Ping(ctx)` when the service is expected to
  fail fast on PostgreSQL unavailability.
- Transaction handle: `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5.Tx`.
- Error type: `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgconn.PgError`.
- Generated pgtype package: `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgtype`.

### 3. Contracts

- Repository adapters may import pgx, pgxpool, pgconn, pgtype, and service-local
  generated sqlc packages.
- HTTP handlers, service business logic, gateway code, and other services must
  not import another service's generated sqlc package.
- Generated sqlc rows and pgtype values must be mapped to service-domain structs
  before leaving `internal/repository`.
- New PostgreSQL services must not introduce `github.com/jackc/pgx/v4` or a
  third pgx major version without updating `docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md`.
- New or regenerated query packages must use the pinned `sqlc@v1.31.1`
  command. Knowledge and QA may still contain older generated code until their
  SQL changes, but the next SQL edit must regenerate with the pinned command
  and commit the result.
- Migrating from `pgxpool.Connect` to `pgxpool.New` must not silently change
  startup behavior. If the old service failed startup when PostgreSQL was
  unreachable, call `pool.Ping(ctx)` before registering the repository.
- Migration behavior is part of the repository contract; changing pgx/sqlc
  wiring still requires goose apply validation for services with migrations.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required response |
| --- | --- |
| `go.mod` or module graph contains `github.com/jackc/pgx/v4` | Remove the v4 dependency or document a formal technology-baseline exception before merging. |
| `sqlc.yaml` uses `sql_package: "pgx/v4"` | Regenerate sqlc with `pgx/v5` and update repository mapping code. |
| Startup code calls a removed/old pool API | Use the pgx v5 pool API, for example `pgxpool.New(ctx, databaseURL)`. |
| Startup must fail fast but only calls `pgxpool.New` | Add `pool.Ping(ctx)` during startup and close the pool on ping failure. |
| HTTP handler imports pgx or generated sqlc | Move database access behind the repository/service boundary. |
| pgtype values leak into service or HTTP response models | Add repository mapping helpers that return domain structs. |
| Migrations fail against an empty PostgreSQL database | Fix migrations or document the remaining risk before PR. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: service `go.mod` requires `pgx/v5@v5.9.2`, `sqlc.yaml` uses
  `pgx/v5`, startup preserves required PostgreSQL reachability checks,
  repository maps `pgtype.Text` / `pgtype.Timestamptz` to domain fields,
  generated query code is refreshed with `sqlc@v1.31.1`, handlers import only
  service interfaces, and goose applies cleanly.
- Base: an existing service migration preserves public/internal API semantics
  and only changes dependency/import/mapping code plus docs.
- Bad: leaving v4 in `go.mod`, hand-editing generated sqlc code without
  updating `sqlc.yaml`, returning generated sqlc rows from handlers, or
  treating unit tests as a substitute for migration apply validation.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run `go test ./...` from the changed service directory.
- Run `go build ./cmd/server` for runnable services.
- Run `go list -m all` and scan for `github.com/jackc/pgx/v4`.
- Scan `services/<service>/internal/http` for pgx and generated sqlc imports.
- Run `git diff --check`.
- For services with migrations, run:

```bash
go run github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@v3.27.1 -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up
```

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```go
import "github.com/jackc/pgx/v4/pgxpool"

pool, err := pgxpool.Connect(ctx, databaseURL)
```

#### Correct

```go
import "github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool"

pool, err := pgxpool.New(ctx, databaseURL)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
if err := pool.Ping(ctx); err != nil {
    pool.Close()
    return err
}
```

---

## Migrations

- Store `goose` migrations in `services/<service>/migrations/`.
- Use forward-only migrations for the first implementation slice unless rollback
  is explicitly supported and verified by the service.
- SQL migrations executed by goose must include `-- +goose Up`; include `-- +goose Down` only when the down path is supported and verified by the service.
- Name migrations with an ordered prefix and action summary:

```text
0001_create_users.sql
0002_add_file_processing_state.sql
```

- CI should validate migrations when migration tooling is introduced.
- Schema changes must be backward-compatible when multiple services or deployments may overlap.

## Scenario: AI Gateway Provider Invocation Logging

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing AI Gateway model invocation persistence, provider
  attempts, chat/embedding/rerank usage summaries, or provider error recording.
- Applies to `services/ai-gateway/internal/service`,
  `services/ai-gateway/internal/repository`,
  `services/ai-gateway/internal/provider`, and
  `services/ai-gateway/migrations`.

### 2. Signatures

- Internal model route:
  - `POST /internal/v1/chat/completions`.
- Database tables:
  - `provider_invocations`.
  - `provider_invocation_attempts`.
- Repository boundary:
  - `RecordProviderInvocation(ctx, invocation, attempts)`.
  - Active credential reads must use a dedicated method such as
    `GetActiveCredential(ctx, profileID)`.

### 3. Contracts

- Provider HTTP calls must happen outside PostgreSQL transactions.
- `provider_invocations` may store request id, caller service, external user id,
  operation, profile id, provider, model, stream flag, status, provider status,
  token usage, duration, attempt count, and normalized error summary.
- `provider_invocation_attempts` may store invocation id, attempt number,
  provider, base URL host only, model, status, provider status, duration, and
  normalized error summary.
- Do not store full request bodies, `messages`, prompt text, generated answer
  text, tool schemas, full tool arguments, tool results, provider bearer tokens,
  API keys, full provider URLs, or raw provider response bodies.
- For streaming calls, use a cancellation-independent short context when writing
  the final invocation summary so caller cancellation can still be recorded.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| Missing/default chat profile | OpenAI-style `not_found_error` or `invalid_request_error` |
| Disabled or wrong-purpose profile | OpenAI-style `invalid_request_error` |
| Missing active credential | OpenAI-style `invalid_request_error` |
| Credential decrypt failure | OpenAI-style `upstream_error` without secret details |
| Provider `401` | OpenAI-style authentication category; no raw body |
| Provider `403` | OpenAI-style permission category; no raw body |
| Provider `429` | OpenAI-style rate limit category; no raw body |
| Provider `5xx` or non-contract response | OpenAI-style upstream error; no raw body |
| Provider timeout | record status `timeout` |
| Caller stream cancellation | record status `cancelled` when observable |
| Invocation record write failure after provider success | return an upstream/internal dependency error without leaking payloads |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: service selects a safe chat profile, decrypts the credential only for
  the provider request, calls provider outside a transaction, then persists a
  sanitized invocation plus one attempt.
- Base: first slice records one attempt per call; retry/fallback can add more
  attempts later without changing the public model invocation contract.
- Bad: storing `messages`, tool arguments, provider raw error bodies, full base
  URLs with path/query, API keys, bearer tokens, or prompt hashes as metrics or
  database fields.

### 6. Tests Required

- Provider tests with fake HTTP servers for success, `401`, `403`, `429`, `5xx`,
  timeout, malformed/non-contract response, and stream cancellation.
- Handler tests asserting chat success is OpenAI-compatible and not wrapped in
  `{ data, requestId }`.
- Function-calling tests asserting `tools`, `tool_choice`,
  `parallel_tool_calls`, `assistant.tool_calls`, `tool_call_id`, and streaming
  `delta.tool_calls` are passed through without AI Gateway executing tools.
- Safety tests asserting responses and invocation summaries do not contain API
  keys, bearer tokens, prompt text, full tool arguments, tool schemas, tool
  results, or raw provider bodies.
- Migration validation with `goose@v3.27.1`; run a real PostgreSQL apply when a
  local or CI database URL is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
chat handler -> provider HTTP call inside DB transaction -> store messages and raw provider error body for debugging
```

#### Correct

```text
chat handler -> service selects profile and decrypts credential -> provider HTTP call outside transaction -> repository stores sanitized invocation and attempt summary
```

## Naming Conventions

PostgreSQL naming:

- Tables: plural snake_case, for example `users`, `knowledge_items`.
- Columns: snake_case, for example `created_at`, `owner_user_id`.
- Primary keys: `id`.
- Foreign keys: `<entity>_id`.
- Indexes: `idx_<table>_<columns>`.
- Unique indexes: `uniq_<table>_<columns>`.

Use UTC timestamps and name them consistently:

- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `deleted_at` for soft delete only when the service actually supports it.

---

## Redis

Use Redis for short-lived data only:

- sessions or token deny-lists,
- cache entries,
- short-lived coordination,
- `asynq` queues.

Rules:

- Every cache key must have a stable prefix: `<service>:<resource>:<id>`.
- Every cache entry must have an explicit TTL unless it is intentionally persistent.
- Redis must not be the only source of durable business truth.
- Cache invalidation must be owned by the service that owns the underlying data.
- Queued task payloads must be JSON and include traceable fields such as
  `requestId`, `jobId`, and `userId` when available. PostgreSQL remains the
  authority for durable job state, final status, failure summary, and retry
  count.

---

## Qdrant

Use Qdrant for vector search only. The `knowledge` service owns collection
creation, vector metadata shape, and retrieval conventions.

Rules:

- Store durable knowledge metadata in PostgreSQL; store vectors and search payloads in Qdrant.
- Keep Qdrant payload fields minimal and retrieval-oriented.
- Version embedding models and collection names or metadata when the embedding shape changes.
- Do not let `qa` mutate Qdrant collections directly; it should retrieve through `knowledge` or a documented retrieval API.
- Do not let `ai-gateway` write Qdrant collections; model generation and vector
  persistence remain separate service responsibilities.

---

## Object Storage

Use the File Service object-store boundary for object payloads:

- uploaded source files,
- extracted text artifacts if they are too large for PostgreSQL,
- generated documents,
- temporary processing outputs when needed.

Rules:

- Store object metadata and ownership in PostgreSQL.
- Use bucket names that map to domain purpose, not implementation detail.
- Generate object keys server-side.
- Never expose raw internal object keys as authorization decisions.
- Prefer pre-signed URLs only after checking ownership and permission in the service.
- `FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND=memory` is for tests and early local development only.
  `local` is acceptable for durable local smoke tests. Production must use
  MinIO or an equivalent persistent object-store adapter.
- MinIO SDK usage must stay inside the File Service platform/storage adapter and
  process wiring. Handlers, owner-service clients, and service use cases depend
  only on the service-owned `ObjectStore` port.
- When adding an HTTP transport timeout for object-store clients, do not cancel
  the request context immediately when `RoundTrip` returns. For streaming
  responses, wrap the response body and cancel on `Body.Close()` so content
  reads are not interrupted.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Redis cache entries as durable workflow state.
- Storing full documents in PostgreSQL when MinIO is the correct storage layer.
- Duplicating knowledge metadata between PostgreSQL and Qdrant without a source-of-truth rule.
- Running external HTTP calls inside PostgreSQL transactions.
- Letting `qa` bypass `knowledge` and directly own retrieval logic.

## Scenario: File Service Base Object Storage

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing File Service base object upload, metadata persistence, object storage adapters, deletion cleanup, or `/internal/v1/files/**` routes.
- Applies to `services/file/internal/service`, `services/file/internal/http`, `services/file/internal/repository`, `services/file/internal/platform/storage`, `services/file/migrations`, and `services/file/api/openapi.yaml`.

### 2. Signatures

- Internal API routes:
  - `POST /internal/v1/files` with multipart field `file` and optional `checksumSha256`.
  - `GET /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`.
  - `DELETE /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`.
  - `GET /internal/v1/files/{fileId}/content`.
- Runtime environment:
  - `FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND=memory|local|minio`.
  - `FILE_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` when using `local`.
  - `FILE_MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `FILE_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`,
    `FILE_MINIO_SECRET_KEY`, and `FILE_MINIO_BUCKET` when using `minio`.
  - Optional `FILE_MINIO_USE_SSL`, `FILE_MINIO_REGION`, and
    `FILE_MINIO_TIMEOUT`.
- Database files:
  - `services/file/sqlc.yaml`.
  - `services/file/internal/repository/queries/file_objects.sql`.
  - `services/file/migrations/0001_create_file_objects.sql` or later forward-only migrations.
- Storage adapters implement the service-owned `ObjectStore` port: `Put(ctx, key, body, contentType, sizeBytes)`, `Get(ctx, key)`, `Delete(ctx, key)`.

### 3. Contracts

- File metadata responses may expose only `id`, `filename`, `contentType`, `sizeBytes`, `checksumSha256`, `createdAt`, and `deletedAt`.
- Responses and logs must not expose `storage_bucket`, `storage_object_key`, object-store URLs, local filesystem paths, access keys, or secret keys.
- PostgreSQL is the durable source of metadata, deletion status, purge timestamps, and sanitized purge failure summaries.
- Object keys are generated server-side from file IDs, never from user filenames.
- `FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND=memory` is test/local-only; `local` is acceptable for local durable smoke tests; production should use MinIO or an equivalent persistent object store adapter.
- MinIO adapter errors returned from the storage layer must be sanitized:
  `NoSuchKey` / missing object maps to `service.ErrNotFound`, timeout and
  cancellation preserve `context` errors, and other SDK failures map to a
  dependency error without embedding bucket names, object keys, endpoints, or
  credentials.
- MinIO upload calls must preserve content type and enable SDK checksum support
  such as `PutObjectOptions.SendContentMd5`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Response/error |
| --- | --- |
| Missing multipart `file` | `400 validation_error` |
| Empty file | `400 validation_error` |
| Oversized/malformed multipart | `400 validation_error` |
| Invalid or mismatched `checksumSha256` | `400 validation_error` |
| Missing trusted caller context | `401 unauthorized` |
| File missing, deleted, or purged | `404 not_found` |
| Storage write/read/delete failure | `502 dependency_error` |
| Metadata write/read/update failure | `502 dependency_error` |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: handler parses multipart and writes only envelope/content headers; service computes checksum, generates object key, coordinates repository plus object store; repository persists explicit file-object columns.
- Base: a local storage adapter persists bytes under a configured directory for smoke tests while preserving the same `ObjectStore` interface.
- Bad: handler imports MinIO or SQL packages, response DTO includes `objectKey` or `bucket`, or owner services use object keys for authorization.

### 6. Tests Required

- Handler tests for malformed multipart, missing file, empty file, oversized file, checksum mismatch, successful content stream headers, and reads after delete.
- Service tests for checksum computation/validation, object key creation, delete state transitions, and storage dependency error mapping.
- Storage adapter tests for put/get/delete, size mismatch, context cancellation where practical, and path traversal rejection for local storage.
- MinIO adapter tests for content type and checksum options, not-found mapping,
  sanitized dependency errors, size mismatch, and timeout/cancellation behavior.
- Repository or migration validation once database test tooling is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
HTTP handler receives upload -> writes object directly to MinIO -> returns objectKey in JSON
```

#### Correct

```text
HTTP handler parses multipart -> service validates checksum and creates FileObject -> repository stores metadata -> ObjectStore stores bytes -> response returns safe FileObject fields only
```

#### Wrong

```text
custom RoundTripper adds context.WithTimeout -> defer cancel() before returning response body -> content reads fail mid-stream
```

#### Correct

```text
custom RoundTripper adds context.WithTimeout -> wraps response body -> cancel happens when Body.Close() is called
```

## Scenario: Knowledge Document Upload And Ingestion Job

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing Knowledge document upload, File Service
  integration, `knowledge_documents.file_ref`, processing job creation, or
  Redis/asynq ingestion handoff.
- Applies to `services/knowledge/internal/http`,
  `services/knowledge/internal/service`, `services/knowledge/internal/repository`,
  `services/knowledge/internal/platform/fileclient`,
  `services/knowledge/internal/platform/queue`, `services/knowledge/api/openapi.yaml`,
  and Knowledge runtime configuration.

### 2. Signatures

- Internal Knowledge route:
  - `POST /internal/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}/documents`
    with multipart field `file` and optional `tags`.
- File Service call:
  - `POST /internal/v1/files` with only base file-object multipart fields.
  - Best-effort compensation uses `DELETE /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`.
- Queue task:
  - asynq task type `knowledge:document:ingest`.
  - JSON payload fields: `requestId`, `jobId`, `documentId`,
    `knowledgeBaseId`, `userId`.
- Required runtime environment keys for upload:
  - `FILE_SERVICE_BASE_URL`.
  - `KNOWLEDGE_REDIS_ADDR`.
  - Optional: `KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `KNOWLEDGE_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`.

### 3. Contracts

- Knowledge owns document resources, document status, and `processing_jobs`.
- File Service owns raw bytes and base file-object metadata. Knowledge persists
  only the returned file ID as internal `knowledge_documents.file_ref`.
- Public or service-local document responses may expose `jobId`, status, display
  filename, content type, size, and tags, but must not expose `fileRef`,
  File Service internal IDs, object keys, buckets, MinIO/internal URLs, raw text,
  vectors, prompts, or tokens.
- PostgreSQL is the durable source for document and processing job state.
  Redis/asynq is only a queue delivery mechanism.
- External HTTP calls must not run inside a PostgreSQL transaction. Validate the
  knowledge base first, call File Service, then create document and job state in
  one short repository transaction, then enqueue the asynq task.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Response/error |
| --- | --- |
| Missing user context | `401 unauthorized` |
| Missing `knowledge:write` permission | `403 forbidden` |
| Missing or empty multipart `file` | `400 validation_error` |
| Malformed or oversized multipart body | `400 validation_error` |
| Invalid `knowledgeBaseId` or hidden knowledge base | `404 not_found` |
| Invalid `tags` shape or value | `400 validation_error` |
| File Service validation failure | `400 validation_error` owned by Knowledge |
| File Service dependency/internal failure | `502 dependency_error` |
| Document/job repository failure after file creation | attempt `DELETE /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`, then return classified repository error |
| Queue handoff failure after durable job creation | mark document/job failed in PostgreSQL, then return `502 dependency_error` |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: handler parses multipart, service validates KB visibility before file
  write, File Service receives only raw file data, repository creates document
  and job atomically, queue payload contains only IDs, and response returns a
  `DocumentSummary` with `jobId`.
- Base: queue failure is reported as dependency failure only after PostgreSQL
  document/job state is durably marked failed.
- Bad: Knowledge stores raw file bytes directly, sends `knowledgeBaseId` or tags
  to File Service, returns `fileRef`/`fileId` publicly, or treats Redis/asynq as
  the authoritative job status store.

### 6. Tests Required

- HTTP handler tests for success, missing file, malformed multipart, JSON-array
  tags, repeated tags, permission failure, and no public file ID leakage.
- Service tests for success orchestration, File Service validation/dependency
  error mapping, repository failure compensation delete, queue failure job mark,
  and pre-file-write knowledge-base visibility validation.
- Repository tests for document/job creation and failed-state marking.
- File client tests with mocked HTTP server asserting multipart shape, context
  headers, safe downstream error mapping, and delete idempotency for `404`.
- Queue adapter tests or code review must confirm payload contains only
  `requestId`, `jobId`, `documentId`, `knowledgeBaseId`, and `userId`.
- Service-local checks from `services/knowledge`: `go test ./...`,
  `go build ./cmd/server`, and `git diff --check`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
Knowledge upload -> File Service stores business metadata -> Redis stores final ingestion status -> response exposes fileId
```

#### Correct

```text
Knowledge upload -> File Service stores raw bytes -> Knowledge transaction creates document + processing_job -> asynq task carries IDs only -> response exposes document summary + jobId
```

## Scenario: Document Service Report Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing Document Service report-generation tables, job persistence, sqlc queries, migrations, queue identifiers, or dependency configuration.
- Applies to `services/document/internal/service`, `services/document/internal/repository`, `services/document/migrations`, `services/document/sqlc.yaml`, and `services/document/internal/config`.

### 2. Signatures

- Database migration files:
  - `services/document/migrations/0001_create_report_generation_tables.sql` or later ordered migrations.
- SQL files:
  - `services/document/sqlc.yaml`.
  - `services/document/internal/repository/queries/*.sql`.
  - Generated code under `services/document/internal/repository/sqlc/`.
- Required runtime environment keys:
  - `DOCUMENT_DATABASE_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_REDIS_ADDR`.
  - `DOCUMENT_FILE_SERVICE_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_AI_GATEWAY_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_AI_GATEWAY_PROFILE_ID`.

### 3. Contracts

- PostgreSQL owns durable report state for report types, templates, materials, reports, outlines, sections, section versions, jobs, attempts, events, files, and operation logs.
- `report_jobs`, `report_job_attempts`, and `report_events` are the durable authority for job status, retry history, failure summaries, and public progress events.
- Report job progress JSON must use numeric `completed` and `total` fields. Terminal status updates (`succeeded`, `partial_succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`) must preserve existing meaningful progress such as `1/2` from multi-step generation, and only write default progress (`1/1` for success-like states, `0/1` for failure-like states) when no detailed progress exists.
- `reports.status`, `reports.latest_job_id`, and `reports.generated_at` are a denormalized public snapshot of generation lifecycle, not the detailed job authority. Generation job `pending`/`running` states must set `latest_job_id` and the matching generating report status. Terminal `partial_succeeded` keeps the report in the closest usable generated state (`outline_generated` for outline jobs, `generated` for content or section jobs), while `failed` and `canceled` map to report `failed`. Content or section `succeeded` and `partial_succeeded` jobs set `generated_at`.
- `report_sections.outline_id` scopes sections to the outline version that created
  or owns them. Report-level `content_generation` and `content_regeneration`
  must generate only sections whose `outline_id` matches the current
  `report_outlines.is_current` row. `section_regeneration` is the explicit
  section-targeted exception and may regenerate the requested section after the
  same-report ownership check.
- AI-generated outline creation and the derived `report_sections` skeleton
  creation are one business write. They must run in one short repository
  transaction after the AI response is parsed; if any skeleton insert fails,
  the new current outline, previous-current flag updates, and partial skeletons
  must all roll back.
- When building JSON with PostgreSQL parameters, cast ambiguous parameters explicitly, for example `jsonb_build_object('completed', $2::int, 'total', $3::int)`, so pgx/PostgreSQL can infer parameter types in integration tests and production.
- Redis/asynq may store queue payloads, delivery metadata, and task identifiers only. It must not be the only source of report job or event truth.
- File bytes for templates, materials, and generated report files belong to the File Service. Document tables may persist only service-internal file references and display metadata, never MinIO object keys or bucket names.
- Repository methods return service-layer domain structs, not generated sqlc rows or raw driver types.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Response/error |
| --- | --- |
| Missing required config value | startup validation error |
| Invalid file or AI Gateway base URL | startup validation error |
| Invalid report/job UUID at repository boundary | `validation_error` |
| Missing report job | `not_found` |
| Duplicate report/job/attempt/event ID | `conflict` |
| Section skeleton insert fails after creating a current outline | rollback outline/current-flag/partial sections and return dependency error |
| PostgreSQL connect/query failure | wrapped dependency error |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: service creates a report job row in PostgreSQL, records attempts/events in PostgreSQL, stores only the asynq task ID for queue correlation, and commits AI outline plus derived section skeletons atomically.
- Base: the first implementation slice provides schema, repository, transactions, health checks, and readiness checks without implementing AI generation or DOCX export.
- Bad: worker stores final job status only in Redis, repository returns sqlc rows to HTTP handlers, outline generation leaves a new current outline with missing/partial skeletons after failure, or public responses/logs expose `file_ref`, object keys, prompts, provider raw errors, or database details.

### 6. Tests Required

- Config tests for required Document Service dependency keys and invalid URL rejection.
- Handler tests for `/healthz` and `/readyz` response envelopes, request ID propagation, and dependency failure status.
- Repository integration tests, gated by `DOCUMENT_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, that apply migrations and verify report type, report, job, attempt, event, and transaction behavior.
- Repository integration tests for multi-step jobs must assert `UpdateReportJobProgress` survives terminal status updates instead of being overwritten by generic `1/1` or `0/1` defaults.
- Service tests for content generation must cover old and current outline
  sections and assert progress totals include only current outline sections.
- Service tests must simulate section skeleton creation failure and assert the
  new current outline and partial skeletons are rolled back.
- Repository integration tests, gated by `DOCUMENT_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, should
  cover the report-generation transaction by creating an outline and section
  inside the transaction, forcing an error, and asserting rollback.
- Build and package checks from `services/document`: `go test ./...`, `go build ./cmd/server`, `sqlc generate`, and migration apply against an empty PostgreSQL database when migration tooling is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
asynq task executes -> Redis stores final job status -> API reads Redis as truth
outline generation -> insert current outline -> skeleton insert fails -> incomplete current outline remains
```

#### Correct

```text
API creates report_job -> asynq task id is stored for correlation -> worker updates report_jobs/report_job_attempts/report_events in PostgreSQL
outline generation -> parse AI response outside transaction -> transaction inserts current outline + skeletons -> rollback all on failure
```

## Scenario: Document Section Version Current Switch

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing Document report section version creation, manual
  section edit snapshotting, or section-regeneration overwrite behavior.
- Applies to `services/document/internal/service/report_service.go`,
  `services/document/internal/service/report_generation_service.go`,
  `services/document/internal/http/reports.go`,
  `services/document/internal/repository/reports.go`, and the matching Document
  and Gateway OpenAPI section-version schemas.

### 2. Signatures

- HTTP route: `POST /reports/{reportId}/sections/{sectionId}/versions`.
- Request fields: `source` (`manual` or `ai`), optional `requirements`,
  optional `content`, optional `tables`.
- Response fields: `id`, `reportId`, `sectionId`, `version`, `source`,
  optional `content`, optional `tables`, optional `jobId`, `createdAt`.
- Durable tables: `report_sections` and `report_section_versions`.

### 3. Contracts

- `report_sections.version` is the current section version reference unless a
  future reviewed migration adds `current_version_id`.
- Creating a section version must insert `report_section_versions` and switch
  the current `report_sections` content/tables/version/source flags in the same
  `ReportRepository.WithinTx` operation.
- Deleted reports are not valid section-version write targets. A report with
  `ReportStatusDeleted` or non-nil `DeletedAt` must return `409 conflict`
  before inserting `report_section_versions` or updating `report_sections`;
  re-check and lock the report row inside the write transaction before the
  insert and current-section switch.
- The next version number must be greater than both `ReportSection.version` and
  every existing `ReportSectionVersion.version`.
- Manual content or table edits through section save/update paths must create a
  `manual` section-version snapshot in the same transaction as the current
  section update.
- Manual section update/save paths must lock and re-check the report row inside
  the write transaction before mutating sections. For each existing section
  they update, they must also re-read and lock the current section inside the
  transaction, require same-report ownership, and reject
  `generation_status = running` with `409 conflict` before writing content,
  tables, version, source, manual-edit state, or manual section-version rows.
- AI generation may call the model outside the database transaction, but the
  final generated content update plus `report_section_versions` insert must run
  in one short `WithinGenerationTx` operation.
- Before calling the model for a section, the generation service must persist
  `generation_status = running` and `last_job_id = <current job>`. If that
  marker update fails, return `dependency_error`, record `section.failed`, keep
  progress at the current completed count, and do not call the AI provider. A
  failed running-marker write is infrastructure failure, not a stale response
  skip.
- Before persisting a successful generated section after the model call, re-read
  and lock the target section inside `WithinGenerationTx`. The current section
  must still have `last_job_id` equal to the executing job, `generation_status =
  running`, and the same `version` / `manual_edited` state captured when the job
  marked the section running. If any of those checks fail, the transaction may
  return an internal `409 conflict`, but the generation service must treat that
  section as skipped: preserve the current section content, tables, version,
  source, manual edit state, `last_job_id`, and generation status; update job
  progress and record a `section.skipped` event; do not create an AI
  section-version row from the stale response.
- If generated content persistence fails after the transaction rolls back,
  failure compensation must use a narrow section status update only
  (`generation_status`, `last_job_id`, `updated_at`). It must not write a stale
  full `report_sections` snapshot over `content`, `tables_json`, `version`,
  `content_source`, or `manual_edited`, and should require `last_job_id` to
  still match the failed generation job before marking `failed`.
- A generated-section success transaction returning `409 conflict` because the
  section changed or the job was superseded is not a generation persistence
  failure. The executor must continue on a non-error result path so the worker
  does not call `markFailed`; the stale AI response must leave the current
  section status intact.
- Manual edit preservation defaults to true. `preserveUserEdits=false` is the
  public option; `preserveManualEdits=false` remains a backward-compatible
  alias. Only an explicit false value may overwrite manual edits.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required response / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `source` is not `manual` or `ai` | `400 validation_error` |
| Report is soft-deleted by status or `deleted_at` | `409 conflict`; do not create a version or mutate the current section |
| Target section belongs to another report | `404 not_found` |
| Target section has `generation_status = running` | `409 conflict`; do not create a version |
| Manual update/save write transaction sees a deleted report or running section | `409 conflict`; do not mutate the current section or create a manual version |
| Running-marker update before AI section generation fails | `dependency_error`; record `section.failed`; update progress with the current completed count; do not call the AI provider, increment completed progress, create a version, or mark the section skipped |
| Successful AI response finds a different `last_job_id`, non-running status, changed version, or changed manual-edit state | Skip the stale section on the non-error execution path; update progress and `section.skipped`; do not create a version, overwrite current section content, or mark the section/job/report failed |
| Version insert succeeds but current-section switch fails | Roll back inserted version and return typed dependency/not-found error |
| AI generated content update succeeds but version insert fails | Roll back the generated content switch; mark the section failed best-effort with a narrow, current-job-matched status update that preserves concurrent edits |
| Manual edit changes only metadata | Do not create a new section version |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `CreateSectionVersion` creates version 4, updates
  `report_sections.version=4`, and returns the same version in one transaction.
- Base: a manual metadata-only title/numbering save updates the current section
  without adding a history row.
- Bad: inserting `report_section_versions` and returning success while
  `report_sections.version` still points at the previous content.

### 6. Tests Required

- Service tests for conflict while generation is running.
- Service tests for deleted-report rejection, including the case where the
  report is deleted after the entry check but before the transactional insert.
- Service tests for version creation plus current-section switch in one
  transaction.
- Rollback tests where current-section update fails after version insertion.
- Manual edit snapshot tests for single-section update and bulk save.
- Manual edit race tests for single-section update and bulk save must simulate
  a report deleted after the entry check and a section becoming
  `generation_status = running` after the entry check; both cases must return
  `409 conflict`, preserve current section content/version/status, and create
  no manual section-version row.
- Generation tests for default preserve behavior, explicit
  `preserveUserEdits=false`, and rollback when version insertion fails.
- Generation tests must simulate `MarkReportSectionGenerationRunning` failure
  before the model call and assert `dependency_error`, no chat request,
  `section.failed`, unchanged section content/status, and no stale skip/success
  event.
- Generation success-path tests must simulate a concurrent manual edit and a
  superseding generation job after the AI call but before the write transaction;
  both cases must preserve the current section, preserve current generation
  status, create no stale AI version, update progress, record
  `section.skipped`, and return a non-error execution result so the worker does
  not mark the job/report failed.
- Generation rollback tests must simulate a concurrent section edit after the
  failed transaction rolls back and assert failure compensation preserves
  `content`, `tables`, `version`, `content_source`, and `manual_edited`.
- HTTP tests that assert `source`, `requirements`, `content`, and `tables` are
  passed through to the service and returned in the response DTO.
- OpenAPI parse/schema checks that Document and Gateway section-version source
  enums and table field names stay aligned.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
POST /sections/{id}/versions -> insert report_section_versions(version=3) -> return 201
report_sections.version remains 2
```

#### Correct

```text
POST /sections/{id}/versions -> transaction:
  insert report_section_versions(version=3)
  update report_sections.content/tables/version/source
return 201 after commit
```

#### Wrong

```text
generation tx fails -> restore old section snapshot -> UPDATE report_sections SET content=old_content, version=old_version, generation_status=failed
```

#### Correct

```text
generation tx fails -> rollback generated content/version -> UPDATE report_sections SET generation_status=failed, updated_at=now WHERE id=$section AND last_job_id=$job
```

#### Wrong

```text
AI call returns -> use pre-call section snapshot -> UPDATE report_sections SET content=generated, version=old+1 WHERE id=$section
```

#### Correct

```text
AI call returns -> transaction:
  SELECT report_sections FOR UPDATE
  require last_job_id=$job, generation_status=running, version/manual_edited unchanged
  update generated content and insert report_section_versions
```

#### Wrong

```text
mark section running fails -> call AI anyway -> success write sees conflict -> count section as skipped -> job succeeds
```

#### Correct

```text
mark section running fails -> record section.failed -> return dependency_error -> worker marks job/report failed
```

## Scenario: Document Initial Report Defaults Seed

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing Document Service report type seeds, default
  report templates, singleton `report_settings`, or first-slice local
  development defaults.
- Applies to `services/document/migrations`,
  `services/document/internal/repository`, and `services/document/README.md`.

### 2. Signatures

- Migration files:
  - `services/document/migrations/0003_seed_initial_report_defaults.sql` or a
    later ordered migration for seed changes.
- Database rows:
  - `report_types.code` values `summer_peak_inspection` and
    `coal_inventory_audit`.
  - `report_templates.id` deterministic seed UUIDs when placeholder templates
    are required.
  - `report_settings.id = 'default'`.
- Settings JSON fields:
  - `llm_json.provider = ai-gateway`.
  - `default_templates_json` maps `reportType -> reportTemplateId`.
  - `file_json.defaultFormat = docx`.
  - `file_json.defaultNumberingMode = global` unless a user value already
    exists.
  - `file_json.defaultStyleProfileId` may reference a non-secret style profile
    identifier.

### 3. Contracts

- Seed migrations must be idempotent. Use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
  for stable rows.
- Seed migrations must not overwrite user modifications. For JSON settings,
  merge seed defaults on the left and existing JSON on the right so existing
  keys win, for example `seed_json || existing_json`.
- Placeholder templates are allowed when formal DOCX templates are missing, but
  they must be explicitly marked with `needs_decision` metadata and a runnable
  import path. They must not pretend to be formal business templates.
- Default settings must not contain provider API keys, provider base URLs,
  object storage details, `file_ref`, object keys, prompts, or internal file
  service identifiers.
- Placeholder template rows should keep `file_ref` null until the File Service
  owns a real uploaded template object.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| Report type already exists | Keep the existing row; do not update name, enabled state, or defaults. |
| Placeholder template already exists | Keep the existing row by primary key. |
| `report_settings` row is missing | Insert the safe singleton default. |
| `report_settings` row exists with user values | Add only missing keys; preserve existing values. |
| Formal template file is not available | Store clear `needs_decision` metadata and no `file_ref`. |
| Seed content includes secrets or internal file references | Reject in review and add/adjust migration tests. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: a follow-up migration seeds missing report types, inserts placeholder
  template metadata with deterministic IDs, and merges settings so user values
  win.
- Base: the first slice can use placeholder templates with no `file_ref` while
  keeping `defaultTemplates` runnable for local development.
- Bad: updating existing report type names on every seed run, hard-coding fake
  production template file references, or storing provider keys in
  `report_settings`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Migration string tests asserting the seed includes report type codes,
  deterministic template IDs, `needs_decision` metadata, import path, and no
  sensitive markers such as API keys or `file_ref`.
- Repository integration tests, gated by `DOCUMENT_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, that
  apply migrations, verify the two enabled report types and default settings,
  re-run the seed migration, and assert no duplicate rows or user-value
  overwrites.
- Service-local checks from `services/document`: `go test ./...`,
  `go build ./cmd/server`, and `git diff --check`.
- Goose migration apply against a real PostgreSQL database when a local or CI
  database is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
seed rerun -> UPDATE report_types SET enabled = true, default_templates_json = stock_defaults
```

#### Correct

```text
seed rerun -> INSERT stable rows ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING -> merge missing settings with existing values taking precedence
```
