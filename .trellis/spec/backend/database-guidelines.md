# Database Guidelines

> Database, cache, vector-search, and object-storage conventions for Go backend services.

---

## Overview

Each backend service owns its persistence concerns. A service may use
PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, or MinIO only through service-local repository or
platform packages. Handlers must not talk directly to infrastructure clients.

Confirmed Go infrastructure stack:

- PostgreSQL: `pgx` + `sqlc`.
- Migrations: `goose`.
- Redis cache/session access: `go-redis`.
- Redis queues: `asynq`.
- Qdrant: a short-term hand-written HTTP client until usage justifies an official or generated client.
- MinIO: official MinIO Go SDK.

Do not introduce an ORM by default. If a service needs one, document the reason
in that service README, update `docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md`,
and then update this spec.

---

## PostgreSQL Ownership

- Each service owns the tables it writes.
- Do not let one service write another service's tables.
- Cross-service data needs should go through HTTP APIs, events, or explicit read-model decisions.
- Table schemas must be represented by migrations under `services/<service>/migrations/`.
- Services that use PostgreSQL must keep service-local `sqlc.yaml`, query files,
  generated `sqlc` code, and `goose` migrations. Generated query structs must
  not leak into HTTP handlers.

Use PostgreSQL for:

- user identities, roles, permissions, sessions, and tokens metadata,
- file metadata and processing states,
- knowledge metadata and ingestion status,
- document generation jobs and outputs metadata,
- audit-friendly business state.

---

## Query Patterns

- Use parameterized queries only. Never concatenate user input into SQL.
- Keep SQL in repository methods or dedicated query files.
- Keep repository methods small and named by intent, not by SQL operation.
- Return domain-oriented structs from repositories; do not leak raw DB rows into handlers.
- Pass `context.Context` through every database call.
- Use pagination for list endpoints.
- Use explicit column lists instead of `SELECT *`.

Example repository shape:

```go
type UserRepository struct {
    db *pgxpool.Pool
}

func (r *UserRepository) FindByID(ctx context.Context, id UserID) (User, error) {
    const query = `
        SELECT id, email, display_name, created_at
        FROM users
        WHERE id = $1
    `
    // scan and wrap errors here
}
```

---

## Transactions

- Start transactions at the service/use-case layer when one business operation changes multiple records.
- Keep transaction bodies short and deterministic.
- Pass transaction handles into repositories through explicit interfaces.
- Roll back on every error and wrap rollback failures only when they add useful context.
- Do not perform slow external calls while holding a PostgreSQL transaction.

---

## Migrations

- Store `goose` migrations in `services/<service>/migrations/`.
- Use forward-only migrations for the first implementation slice unless rollback
  is explicitly supported and verified by the service.
- SQL migrations executed by goose must include `-- +goose Up`; include `-- +goose Down` only when the down path is supported and verified by the service.
- Name migrations with an ordered prefix and action summary:

```text
0001_create_users.sql
0002_add_file_processing_state.sql
```

- CI should validate migrations when migration tooling is introduced.
- Schema changes must be backward-compatible when multiple services or deployments may overlap.

## Scenario: AI Gateway Provider Invocation Logging

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing AI Gateway model invocation persistence, provider
  attempts, chat/embedding/rerank usage summaries, or provider error recording.
- Applies to `services/ai-gateway/internal/service`,
  `services/ai-gateway/internal/repository`,
  `services/ai-gateway/internal/provider`, and
  `services/ai-gateway/migrations`.

### 2. Signatures

- Internal model route:
  - `POST /internal/v1/chat/completions`.
- Database tables:
  - `provider_invocations`.
  - `provider_invocation_attempts`.
- Repository boundary:
  - `RecordProviderInvocation(ctx, invocation, attempts)`.
  - Active credential reads must use a dedicated method such as
    `GetActiveCredential(ctx, profileID)`.

### 3. Contracts

- Provider HTTP calls must happen outside PostgreSQL transactions.
- `provider_invocations` may store request id, caller service, external user id,
  operation, profile id, provider, model, stream flag, status, provider status,
  token usage, duration, attempt count, and normalized error summary.
- `provider_invocation_attempts` may store invocation id, attempt number,
  provider, base URL host only, model, status, provider status, duration, and
  normalized error summary.
- Do not store full request bodies, `messages`, prompt text, generated answer
  text, tool schemas, full tool arguments, tool results, provider bearer tokens,
  API keys, full provider URLs, or raw provider response bodies.
- For streaming calls, use a cancellation-independent short context when writing
  the final invocation summary so caller cancellation can still be recorded.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| Missing/default chat profile | OpenAI-style `not_found_error` or `invalid_request_error` |
| Disabled or wrong-purpose profile | OpenAI-style `invalid_request_error` |
| Missing active credential | OpenAI-style `invalid_request_error` |
| Credential decrypt failure | OpenAI-style `upstream_error` without secret details |
| Provider `401` | OpenAI-style authentication category; no raw body |
| Provider `403` | OpenAI-style permission category; no raw body |
| Provider `429` | OpenAI-style rate limit category; no raw body |
| Provider `5xx` or non-contract response | OpenAI-style upstream error; no raw body |
| Provider timeout | record status `timeout` |
| Caller stream cancellation | record status `cancelled` when observable |
| Invocation record write failure after provider success | return an upstream/internal dependency error without leaking payloads |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: service selects a safe chat profile, decrypts the credential only for
  the provider request, calls provider outside a transaction, then persists a
  sanitized invocation plus one attempt.
- Base: first slice records one attempt per call; retry/fallback can add more
  attempts later without changing the public model invocation contract.
- Bad: storing `messages`, tool arguments, provider raw error bodies, full base
  URLs with path/query, API keys, bearer tokens, or prompt hashes as metrics or
  database fields.

### 6. Tests Required

- Provider tests with fake HTTP servers for success, `401`, `403`, `429`, `5xx`,
  timeout, malformed/non-contract response, and stream cancellation.
- Handler tests asserting chat success is OpenAI-compatible and not wrapped in
  `{ data, requestId }`.
- Function-calling tests asserting `tools`, `tool_choice`,
  `parallel_tool_calls`, `assistant.tool_calls`, `tool_call_id`, and streaming
  `delta.tool_calls` are passed through without AI Gateway executing tools.
- Safety tests asserting responses and invocation summaries do not contain API
  keys, bearer tokens, prompt text, full tool arguments, tool schemas, tool
  results, or raw provider bodies.
- Migration validation with `goose@v3.27.1`; run a real PostgreSQL apply when a
  local or CI database URL is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
chat handler -> provider HTTP call inside DB transaction -> store messages and raw provider error body for debugging
```

#### Correct

```text
chat handler -> service selects profile and decrypts credential -> provider HTTP call outside transaction -> repository stores sanitized invocation and attempt summary
```

---

## Naming Conventions

PostgreSQL naming:

- Tables: plural snake_case, for example `users`, `knowledge_items`.
- Columns: snake_case, for example `created_at`, `owner_user_id`.
- Primary keys: `id`.
- Foreign keys: `<entity>_id`.
- Indexes: `idx_<table>_<columns>`.
- Unique indexes: `uniq_<table>_<columns>`.

Use UTC timestamps and name them consistently:

- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `deleted_at` for soft delete only when the service actually supports it.

---

## Redis

Use Redis for short-lived data only:

- sessions or token deny-lists,
- cache entries,
- short-lived coordination,
- `asynq` queues.

Rules:

- Every cache key must have a stable prefix: `<service>:<resource>:<id>`.
- Every cache entry must have an explicit TTL unless it is intentionally persistent.
- Redis must not be the only source of durable business truth.
- Cache invalidation must be owned by the service that owns the underlying data.
- Queued task payloads must be JSON and include traceable fields such as
  `requestId`, `jobId`, and `userId` when available. PostgreSQL remains the
  authority for durable job state, final status, failure summary, and retry
  count.

---

## Qdrant

Use Qdrant for vector search only. The `knowledge` service owns collection
creation, vector metadata shape, and retrieval conventions.

Rules:

- Store durable knowledge metadata in PostgreSQL; store vectors and search payloads in Qdrant.
- Keep Qdrant payload fields minimal and retrieval-oriented.
- Version embedding models and collection names or metadata when the embedding shape changes.
- Do not let `qa` mutate Qdrant collections directly; it should retrieve through `knowledge` or a documented retrieval API.
- Do not let `ai-gateway` write Qdrant collections; model generation and vector
  persistence remain separate service responsibilities.

---

## MinIO

Use MinIO for object payloads:

- uploaded source files,
- extracted text artifacts if they are too large for PostgreSQL,
- generated documents,
- temporary processing outputs when needed.

Rules:

- Store object metadata and ownership in PostgreSQL.
- Use bucket names that map to domain purpose, not implementation detail.
- Generate object keys server-side.
- Never expose raw internal object keys as authorization decisions.
- Prefer pre-signed URLs only after checking ownership and permission in the service.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Redis cache entries as durable workflow state.
- Storing full documents in PostgreSQL when MinIO is the correct storage layer.
- Duplicating knowledge metadata between PostgreSQL and Qdrant without a source-of-truth rule.
- Running external HTTP calls inside PostgreSQL transactions.
- Letting `qa` bypass `knowledge` and directly own retrieval logic.

## Scenario: File Service Base Object Storage

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing File Service base object upload, metadata persistence, object storage adapters, deletion cleanup, or `/internal/v1/files/**` routes.
- Applies to `services/file/internal/service`, `services/file/internal/http`, `services/file/internal/repository`, `services/file/internal/platform/storage`, `services/file/migrations`, and `services/file/api/openapi.yaml`.

### 2. Signatures

- Internal API routes:
  - `POST /internal/v1/files` with multipart field `file` and optional `checksumSha256`.
  - `GET /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`.
  - `DELETE /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`.
  - `GET /internal/v1/files/{fileId}/content`.
- Database files:
  - `services/file/sqlc.yaml`.
  - `services/file/internal/repository/queries/file_objects.sql`.
  - `services/file/migrations/0001_create_file_objects.sql` or later forward-only migrations.
- Storage adapters implement the service-owned `ObjectStore` port: `Put(ctx, key, body, contentType, sizeBytes)`, `Get(ctx, key)`, `Delete(ctx, key)`.

### 3. Contracts

- File metadata responses may expose only `id`, `filename`, `contentType`, `sizeBytes`, `checksumSha256`, `createdAt`, and `deletedAt`.
- Responses and logs must not expose `storage_bucket`, `storage_object_key`, object-store URLs, local filesystem paths, access keys, or secret keys.
- PostgreSQL is the durable source of metadata, deletion status, purge timestamps, and sanitized purge failure summaries.
- Object keys are generated server-side from file IDs, never from user filenames.
- `FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND=memory` is test/local-only; `local` is acceptable for local durable smoke tests; production should use MinIO or an equivalent persistent object store adapter.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Response/error |
| --- | --- |
| Missing multipart `file` | `400 validation_error` |
| Empty file | `400 validation_error` |
| Oversized/malformed multipart | `400 validation_error` |
| Invalid or mismatched `checksumSha256` | `400 validation_error` |
| Missing trusted caller context | `401 unauthorized` |
| File missing, deleted, or purged | `404 not_found` |
| Storage write/read/delete failure | `502 dependency_error` |
| Metadata write/read/update failure | `502 dependency_error` |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: handler parses multipart and writes only envelope/content headers; service computes checksum, generates object key, coordinates repository plus object store; repository persists explicit file-object columns.
- Base: a local storage adapter persists bytes under a configured directory for smoke tests while preserving the same `ObjectStore` interface.
- Bad: handler imports MinIO or SQL packages, response DTO includes `objectKey` or `bucket`, or owner services use object keys for authorization.

### 6. Tests Required

- Handler tests for malformed multipart, missing file, empty file, oversized file, checksum mismatch, successful content stream headers, and reads after delete.
- Service tests for checksum computation/validation, object key creation, delete state transitions, and storage dependency error mapping.
- Storage adapter tests for put/get/delete, size mismatch, context cancellation where practical, and path traversal rejection for local storage.
- Repository or migration validation once database test tooling is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
HTTP handler receives upload -> writes object directly to MinIO -> returns objectKey in JSON
```

#### Correct

```text
HTTP handler parses multipart -> service validates checksum and creates FileObject -> repository stores metadata -> ObjectStore stores bytes -> response returns safe FileObject fields only
```

## Scenario: Knowledge Document Upload And Ingestion Job

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing Knowledge document upload, File Service
  integration, `knowledge_documents.file_ref`, processing job creation, or
  Redis/asynq ingestion handoff.
- Applies to `services/knowledge/internal/http`,
  `services/knowledge/internal/service`, `services/knowledge/internal/repository`,
  `services/knowledge/internal/platform/fileclient`,
  `services/knowledge/internal/platform/queue`, `services/knowledge/api/openapi.yaml`,
  and Knowledge runtime configuration.

### 2. Signatures

- Internal Knowledge route:
  - `POST /internal/v1/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}/documents`
    with multipart field `file` and optional `tags`.
- File Service call:
  - `POST /internal/v1/files` with only base file-object multipart fields.
  - Best-effort compensation uses `DELETE /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`.
- Queue task:
  - asynq task type `knowledge:document:ingest`.
  - JSON payload fields: `requestId`, `jobId`, `documentId`,
    `knowledgeBaseId`, `userId`.
- Required runtime environment keys for upload:
  - `FILE_SERVICE_BASE_URL`.
  - `KNOWLEDGE_REDIS_ADDR`.
  - Optional: `KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `KNOWLEDGE_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`.

### 3. Contracts

- Knowledge owns document resources, document status, and `processing_jobs`.
- File Service owns raw bytes and base file-object metadata. Knowledge persists
  only the returned file ID as internal `knowledge_documents.file_ref`.
- Public or service-local document responses may expose `jobId`, status, display
  filename, content type, size, and tags, but must not expose `fileRef`,
  File Service internal IDs, object keys, buckets, MinIO/internal URLs, raw text,
  vectors, prompts, or tokens.
- PostgreSQL is the durable source for document and processing job state.
  Redis/asynq is only a queue delivery mechanism.
- External HTTP calls must not run inside a PostgreSQL transaction. Validate the
  knowledge base first, call File Service, then create document and job state in
  one short repository transaction, then enqueue the asynq task.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Response/error |
| --- | --- |
| Missing user context | `401 unauthorized` |
| Missing `knowledge:write` permission | `403 forbidden` |
| Missing or empty multipart `file` | `400 validation_error` |
| Malformed or oversized multipart body | `400 validation_error` |
| Invalid `knowledgeBaseId` or hidden knowledge base | `404 not_found` |
| Invalid `tags` shape or value | `400 validation_error` |
| File Service validation failure | `400 validation_error` owned by Knowledge |
| File Service dependency/internal failure | `502 dependency_error` |
| Document/job repository failure after file creation | attempt `DELETE /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`, then return classified repository error |
| Queue handoff failure after durable job creation | mark document/job failed in PostgreSQL, then return `502 dependency_error` |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: handler parses multipart, service validates KB visibility before file
  write, File Service receives only raw file data, repository creates document
  and job atomically, queue payload contains only IDs, and response returns a
  `DocumentSummary` with `jobId`.
- Base: queue failure is reported as dependency failure only after PostgreSQL
  document/job state is durably marked failed.
- Bad: Knowledge stores raw file bytes directly, sends `knowledgeBaseId` or tags
  to File Service, returns `fileRef`/`fileId` publicly, or treats Redis/asynq as
  the authoritative job status store.

### 6. Tests Required

- HTTP handler tests for success, missing file, malformed multipart, JSON-array
  tags, repeated tags, permission failure, and no public file ID leakage.
- Service tests for success orchestration, File Service validation/dependency
  error mapping, repository failure compensation delete, queue failure job mark,
  and pre-file-write knowledge-base visibility validation.
- Repository tests for document/job creation and failed-state marking.
- File client tests with mocked HTTP server asserting multipart shape, context
  headers, safe downstream error mapping, and delete idempotency for `404`.
- Queue adapter tests or code review must confirm payload contains only
  `requestId`, `jobId`, `documentId`, `knowledgeBaseId`, and `userId`.
- Service-local checks from `services/knowledge`: `go test ./...`,
  `go build ./cmd/server`, and `git diff --check`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
Knowledge upload -> File Service stores business metadata -> Redis stores final ingestion status -> response exposes fileId
```

#### Correct

```text
Knowledge upload -> File Service stores raw bytes -> Knowledge transaction creates document + processing_job -> asynq task carries IDs only -> response exposes document summary + jobId
```

## Scenario: Document Service Report Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing Document Service report-generation tables, job persistence, sqlc queries, migrations, queue identifiers, or dependency configuration.
- Applies to `services/document/internal/service`, `services/document/internal/repository`, `services/document/migrations`, `services/document/sqlc.yaml`, and `services/document/internal/config`.

### 2. Signatures

- Database migration files:
  - `services/document/migrations/0001_create_report_generation_tables.sql` or later ordered migrations.
- SQL files:
  - `services/document/sqlc.yaml`.
  - `services/document/internal/repository/queries/*.sql`.
  - Generated code under `services/document/internal/repository/sqlc/`.
- Required runtime environment keys:
  - `DOCUMENT_DATABASE_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_REDIS_ADDR`.
  - `DOCUMENT_FILE_SERVICE_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_AI_GATEWAY_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_AI_GATEWAY_PROFILE_ID`.

### 3. Contracts

- PostgreSQL owns durable report state for report types, templates, materials, reports, outlines, sections, section versions, jobs, attempts, events, files, and operation logs.
- `report_jobs`, `report_job_attempts`, and `report_events` are the durable authority for job status, retry history, failure summaries, and public progress events.
- Redis/asynq may store queue payloads, delivery metadata, and task identifiers only. It must not be the only source of report job or event truth.
- File bytes for templates, materials, and generated report files belong to the File Service. Document tables may persist only service-internal file references and display metadata, never MinIO object keys or bucket names.
- Repository methods return service-layer domain structs, not generated sqlc rows or raw driver types.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Response/error |
| --- | --- |
| Missing required config value | startup validation error |
| Invalid file or AI Gateway base URL | startup validation error |
| Invalid report/job UUID at repository boundary | `validation_error` |
| Missing report job | `not_found` |
| Duplicate report/job/attempt/event ID | `conflict` |
| PostgreSQL connect/query failure | wrapped dependency error |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: service creates a report job row in PostgreSQL, records attempts/events in PostgreSQL, and stores only the asynq task ID for queue correlation.
- Base: the first implementation slice provides schema, repository, transactions, health checks, and readiness checks without implementing AI generation or DOCX export.
- Bad: worker stores final job status only in Redis, repository returns sqlc rows to HTTP handlers, or public responses/logs expose `file_ref`, object keys, prompts, provider raw errors, or database details.

### 6. Tests Required

- Config tests for required Document Service dependency keys and invalid URL rejection.
- Handler tests for `/healthz` and `/readyz` response envelopes, request ID propagation, and dependency failure status.
- Repository integration tests, gated by `DOCUMENT_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, that apply migrations and verify report type, report, job, attempt, event, and transaction behavior.
- Build and package checks from `services/document`: `go test ./...`, `go build ./cmd/server`, `sqlc generate`, and migration apply against an empty PostgreSQL database when migration tooling is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
asynq task executes -> Redis stores final job status -> API reads Redis as truth
```

#### Correct

```text
API creates report_job -> asynq task id is stored for correlation -> worker updates report_jobs/report_job_attempts/report_events in PostgreSQL
```
