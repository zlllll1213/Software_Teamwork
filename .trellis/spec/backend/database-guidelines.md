# Database Guidelines

> Database, cache, vector-search, and object-storage conventions for Go backend services.

---

## Overview

Each backend service owns its persistence concerns. A service may use
PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, or MinIO only through service-local repository or
platform packages. Handlers must not talk directly to infrastructure clients.

Confirmed Go infrastructure stack:

- PostgreSQL: `pgx` + `sqlc`.
- Migrations: `goose`.
- Redis cache/session access: `go-redis`.
- Redis queues: `asynq`.
- Qdrant: a short-term hand-written HTTP client until usage justifies an official or generated client.
- MinIO: official MinIO Go SDK.

Do not introduce an ORM by default. If a service needs one, document the reason
in that service README, update `docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md`,
and then update this spec.

---

## PostgreSQL Ownership

- Each service owns the tables it writes.
- Do not let one service write another service's tables.
- Cross-service data needs should go through HTTP APIs, events, or explicit read-model decisions.
- Table schemas must be represented by migrations under `services/<service>/migrations/`.
- Services that use PostgreSQL must keep service-local `sqlc.yaml`, query files,
  generated `sqlc` code, and `goose` migrations. Generated query structs must
  not leak into HTTP handlers.

Use PostgreSQL for:

- user identities, roles, permissions, sessions, and tokens metadata,
- file metadata and processing states,
- knowledge metadata and ingestion status,
- document generation jobs and outputs metadata,
- audit-friendly business state.

---

## Query Patterns

- Use parameterized queries only. Never concatenate user input into SQL.
- Keep SQL in repository methods or dedicated query files.
- Keep repository methods small and named by intent, not by SQL operation.
- Return domain-oriented structs from repositories; do not leak raw DB rows into handlers.
- Pass `context.Context` through every database call.
- Use pagination for list endpoints.
- Use explicit column lists instead of `SELECT *`.

Example repository shape:

```go
type UserRepository struct {
    db *pgxpool.Pool
}

func (r *UserRepository) FindByID(ctx context.Context, id UserID) (User, error) {
    const query = `
        SELECT id, email, display_name, created_at
        FROM users
        WHERE id = $1
    `
    // scan and wrap errors here
}
```

---

## Transactions

- Start transactions at the service/use-case layer when one business operation changes multiple records.
- Keep transaction bodies short and deterministic.
- Pass transaction handles into repositories through explicit interfaces.
- Roll back on every error and wrap rollback failures only when they add useful context.
- Do not perform slow external calls while holding a PostgreSQL transaction.

---

## Migrations

- Store `goose` migrations in `services/<service>/migrations/`.
- Use forward-only migrations for the first implementation slice unless rollback
  is explicitly supported and verified by the service.
- SQL migrations executed by goose must include `-- +goose Up`; include `-- +goose Down` only when the down path is supported and verified by the service.
- Name migrations with an ordered prefix and action summary:

```text
0001_create_users.sql
0002_add_file_processing_state.sql
```

- CI should validate migrations when migration tooling is introduced.
- Schema changes must be backward-compatible when multiple services or deployments may overlap.

---

## Naming Conventions

PostgreSQL naming:

- Tables: plural snake_case, for example `users`, `knowledge_items`.
- Columns: snake_case, for example `created_at`, `owner_user_id`.
- Primary keys: `id`.
- Foreign keys: `<entity>_id`.
- Indexes: `idx_<table>_<columns>`.
- Unique indexes: `uniq_<table>_<columns>`.

Use UTC timestamps and name them consistently:

- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `deleted_at` for soft delete only when the service actually supports it.

---

## Redis

Use Redis for short-lived data only:

- sessions or token deny-lists,
- cache entries,
- short-lived coordination,
- `asynq` queues.

Rules:

- Every cache key must have a stable prefix: `<service>:<resource>:<id>`.
- Every cache entry must have an explicit TTL unless it is intentionally persistent.
- Redis must not be the only source of durable business truth.
- Cache invalidation must be owned by the service that owns the underlying data.
- Queued task payloads must be JSON and include traceable fields such as
  `requestId`, `jobId`, and `userId` when available. PostgreSQL remains the
  authority for durable job state, final status, failure summary, and retry
  count.

---

## Qdrant

Use Qdrant for vector search only. The `knowledge` service owns collection
creation, vector metadata shape, and retrieval conventions.

Rules:

- Store durable knowledge metadata in PostgreSQL; store vectors and search payloads in Qdrant.
- Keep Qdrant payload fields minimal and retrieval-oriented.
- Version embedding models and collection names or metadata when the embedding shape changes.
- Do not let `qa` mutate Qdrant collections directly; it should retrieve through `knowledge` or a documented retrieval API.
- Do not let `ai-gateway` write Qdrant collections; model generation and vector
  persistence remain separate service responsibilities.

---

## MinIO

Use MinIO for object payloads:

- uploaded source files,
- extracted text artifacts if they are too large for PostgreSQL,
- generated documents,
- temporary processing outputs when needed.

Rules:

- Store object metadata and ownership in PostgreSQL.
- Use bucket names that map to domain purpose, not implementation detail.
- Generate object keys server-side.
- Never expose raw internal object keys as authorization decisions.
- Prefer pre-signed URLs only after checking ownership and permission in the service.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Redis cache entries as durable workflow state.
- Storing full documents in PostgreSQL when MinIO is the correct storage layer.
- Duplicating knowledge metadata between PostgreSQL and Qdrant without a source-of-truth rule.
- Running external HTTP calls inside PostgreSQL transactions.
- Letting `qa` bypass `knowledge` and directly own retrieval logic.

## Scenario: File Service Base Object Storage

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing File Service base object upload, metadata persistence, object storage adapters, deletion cleanup, or `/internal/v1/files/**` routes.
- Applies to `services/file/internal/service`, `services/file/internal/http`, `services/file/internal/repository`, `services/file/internal/platform/storage`, `services/file/migrations`, and `services/file/api/openapi.yaml`.

### 2. Signatures

- Internal API routes:
  - `POST /internal/v1/files` with multipart field `file` and optional `checksumSha256`.
  - `GET /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`.
  - `DELETE /internal/v1/files/{fileId}`.
  - `GET /internal/v1/files/{fileId}/content`.
- Database files:
  - `services/file/sqlc.yaml`.
  - `services/file/internal/repository/queries/file_objects.sql`.
  - `services/file/migrations/0001_create_file_objects.sql` or later forward-only migrations.
- Storage adapters implement the service-owned `ObjectStore` port: `Put(ctx, key, body, contentType, sizeBytes)`, `Get(ctx, key)`, `Delete(ctx, key)`.

### 3. Contracts

- File metadata responses may expose only `id`, `filename`, `contentType`, `sizeBytes`, `checksumSha256`, `createdAt`, and `deletedAt`.
- Responses and logs must not expose `storage_bucket`, `storage_object_key`, object-store URLs, local filesystem paths, access keys, or secret keys.
- PostgreSQL is the durable source of metadata, deletion status, purge timestamps, and sanitized purge failure summaries.
- Object keys are generated server-side from file IDs, never from user filenames.
- `FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND=memory` is test/local-only; `local` is acceptable for local durable smoke tests; production should use MinIO or an equivalent persistent object store adapter.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Response/error |
| --- | --- |
| Missing multipart `file` | `400 validation_error` |
| Empty file | `400 validation_error` |
| Oversized/malformed multipart | `400 validation_error` |
| Invalid or mismatched `checksumSha256` | `400 validation_error` |
| Missing trusted caller context | `401 unauthorized` |
| File missing, deleted, or purged | `404 not_found` |
| Storage write/read/delete failure | `502 dependency_error` |
| Metadata write/read/update failure | `502 dependency_error` |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: handler parses multipart and writes only envelope/content headers; service computes checksum, generates object key, coordinates repository plus object store; repository persists explicit file-object columns.
- Base: a local storage adapter persists bytes under a configured directory for smoke tests while preserving the same `ObjectStore` interface.
- Bad: handler imports MinIO or SQL packages, response DTO includes `objectKey` or `bucket`, or owner services use object keys for authorization.

### 6. Tests Required

- Handler tests for malformed multipart, missing file, empty file, oversized file, checksum mismatch, successful content stream headers, and reads after delete.
- Service tests for checksum computation/validation, object key creation, delete state transitions, and storage dependency error mapping.
- Storage adapter tests for put/get/delete, size mismatch, context cancellation where practical, and path traversal rejection for local storage.
- Repository or migration validation once database test tooling is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
HTTP handler receives upload -> writes object directly to MinIO -> returns objectKey in JSON
```

#### Correct

```text
HTTP handler parses multipart -> service validates checksum and creates FileObject -> repository stores metadata -> ObjectStore stores bytes -> response returns safe FileObject fields only
```

## Scenario: Document Service Report Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing Document Service report-generation tables, job persistence, sqlc queries, migrations, queue identifiers, or dependency configuration.
- Applies to `services/document/internal/service`, `services/document/internal/repository`, `services/document/migrations`, `services/document/sqlc.yaml`, and `services/document/internal/config`.

### 2. Signatures

- Database migration files:
  - `services/document/migrations/0001_create_report_generation_tables.sql` or later ordered migrations.
- SQL files:
  - `services/document/sqlc.yaml`.
  - `services/document/internal/repository/queries/*.sql`.
  - Generated code under `services/document/internal/repository/sqlc/`.
- Required runtime environment keys:
  - `DOCUMENT_DATABASE_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_REDIS_ADDR`.
  - `DOCUMENT_FILE_SERVICE_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_AI_GATEWAY_URL`.
  - `DOCUMENT_AI_GATEWAY_PROFILE_ID`.

### 3. Contracts

- PostgreSQL owns durable report state for report types, templates, materials, reports, outlines, sections, section versions, jobs, attempts, events, files, and operation logs.
- `report_jobs`, `report_job_attempts`, and `report_events` are the durable authority for job status, retry history, failure summaries, and public progress events.
- Redis/asynq may store queue payloads, delivery metadata, and task identifiers only. It must not be the only source of report job or event truth.
- File bytes for templates, materials, and generated report files belong to the File Service. Document tables may persist only service-internal file references and display metadata, never MinIO object keys or bucket names.
- Repository methods return service-layer domain structs, not generated sqlc rows or raw driver types.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Response/error |
| --- | --- |
| Missing required config value | startup validation error |
| Invalid file or AI Gateway base URL | startup validation error |
| Invalid report/job UUID at repository boundary | `validation_error` |
| Missing report job | `not_found` |
| Duplicate report/job/attempt/event ID | `conflict` |
| PostgreSQL connect/query failure | wrapped dependency error |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: service creates a report job row in PostgreSQL, records attempts/events in PostgreSQL, and stores only the asynq task ID for queue correlation.
- Base: the first implementation slice provides schema, repository, transactions, health checks, and readiness checks without implementing AI generation or DOCX export.
- Bad: worker stores final job status only in Redis, repository returns sqlc rows to HTTP handlers, or public responses/logs expose `file_ref`, object keys, prompts, provider raw errors, or database details.

### 6. Tests Required

- Config tests for required Document Service dependency keys and invalid URL rejection.
- Handler tests for `/healthz` and `/readyz` response envelopes, request ID propagation, and dependency failure status.
- Repository integration tests, gated by `DOCUMENT_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, that apply migrations and verify report type, report, job, attempt, event, and transaction behavior.
- Build and package checks from `services/document`: `go test ./...`, `go build ./cmd/server`, `sqlc generate`, and migration apply against an empty PostgreSQL database when migration tooling is available.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
asynq task executes -> Redis stores final job status -> API reads Redis as truth
```

#### Correct

```text
API creates report_job -> asynq task id is stored for correlation -> worker updates report_jobs/report_job_attempts/report_events in PostgreSQL
```
