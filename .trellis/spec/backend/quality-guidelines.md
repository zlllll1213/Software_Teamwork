# Quality Guidelines

> Code quality standards for Go backend services.

---

## Overview

Every backend service must remain independently testable, buildable, and
deployable. Quality checks run from each service directory because every service
owns a separate `go.mod`.

Minimum Go service-local checks:

```bash
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/server
```

`services/parser/` is a Python runtime boundary rather than a Go service. When
changing Parser, run these checks from `services/parser`:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
uv run python -m compileall src tests
```

### Parser Real PaddleOCR Smoke

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing Parser PaddleOCR runtime code, model loading behavior,
  deployment resource docs, or local OCR smoke commands.
- Applies to `services/parser` tests/docs and Parser runbook entries.

#### 2. Signatures

```bash
PARSER_PADDLEOCR_SMOKE=1 \
PARSER_PADDLEOCR_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD=1 \
uv run pytest -m paddleocr_smoke -s
```

Offline or deployment-like runs should use:

```bash
PARSER_PADDLEOCR_SMOKE=1 \
PARSER_PADDLEOCR_CONFIG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/paddlex.yaml \
uv run pytest -m paddleocr_smoke -s
```

#### 3. Contracts

- Without `PARSER_PADDLEOCR_SMOKE=1`, the real model smoke must skip and ordinary
  Parser CI must rely on fake OCR tests.
- With `PARSER_PADDLEOCR_SMOKE=1`, missing PaddleOCR/PaddlePaddle runtime or
  missing model policy must produce an actionable local test failure.
- The smoke must call the Parser PaddleOCR backend path and assert non-empty OCR
  output from a small fixture.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| Smoke env unset | `pytest.skip`, ordinary CI passes without PaddleOCR. |
| Runtime modules missing | Fail with install command such as `uv sync --group dev --extra paddleocr`. |
| No local model config and downloads not allowed | Fail with `PARSER_PADDLEOCR_CONFIG_PATH` or `PARSER_PADDLEOCR_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD` guidance. |
| OCR returns empty content | Fail with fixture, language/device, and model-completeness guidance. |

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: default `uv run pytest` skips real model smoke, while an explicit local
  env run validates model loading and fixture OCR.
- Base: PR records that only fake OCR checks ran because the local machine lacks
  PaddleOCR models.
- Bad: ordinary CI downloads PaddleOCR models, or a smoke failure emits raw
  provider/debug bodies instead of a short actionable diagnostic.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Parser fake OCR suite: `uv run pytest`.
- Parser lint: `uv run ruff check .`.
- Parser compile: `uv run python -m compileall src tests`.
- For PaddleOCR runtime/resource changes, run the env-gated smoke when a real
  model environment is available; otherwise record why it was skipped.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```bash
uv run pytest  # implicitly downloads real OCR models in CI
```

Correct:

```bash
uv run pytest  # fake OCR only; real model smoke skipped
PARSER_PADDLEOCR_SMOKE=1 PARSER_PADDLEOCR_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD=1 \
  uv run pytest -m paddleocr_smoke -s
```

When lint tooling is introduced, CI should run the selected linter for each
changed service.

## Go Service CI Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing repository CI for landed Go services under `services/*`.

### 2. Signatures

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/go-services.yml`.
- Events: `pull_request` and `push` to `develop` with path filters for `services/**` and the workflow file.
- Matrix key: `service`, with one entry for each landed Go service that owns a `go.mod`.

### 3. Contracts

- Toolchain: `actions/setup-go@v5` with `go-version: '1.25.x'`.
- Working directory: `services/${{ matrix.service }}`.
- Required commands for every matrix service: `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/server`.
- QA contract: run `go build ./cmd/agent` when `services/qa/cmd/agent` exists.
- Cache dependency input must exist for every matrix service; use `services/${{ matrix.service }}/go.mod` unless all services have `go.sum`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Service directory has `go.mod` but no matrix entry | Add it before merging CI changes. |
| Matrix entry has no `services/<name>/go.mod` | Remove or fix the entry; setup/run will fail. |
| Dockerfile Go image diverges from module baseline | Update module and Go build image together. |
| `services/qa/cmd/agent` exists but CI does not build it | Add or restore the QA agent build step. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `services/qa` runs tests, server build, and agent build under Go `1.25.x`.
- Base: a service with no `go.sum` still caches against its existing `go.mod`.
- Bad: a root-level Go workflow runs from the repository root and assumes a root `go.mod`.

### 6. Tests Required

- For each changed Go service, run `go test ./...` from the service directory.
- For each changed Go service, run `go build ./cmd/server` from the service directory.
- For QA, also run `go build ./cmd/agent` from `services/qa`.
- Run `git diff --check` before commit.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```yaml
with:
  go-version: '1.25.x'
  cache-dependency-path: services/${{ matrix.service }}/go.sum
```

Correct when not every service has `go.sum`:

```yaml
with:
  go-version: '1.25.x'
  cache-dependency-path: services/${{ matrix.service }}/go.mod
```

---

## Go Migration CI Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing repository CI for service-owned PostgreSQL migrations under `services/*/migrations`.

### 2. Signatures

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/go-migrations.yml`.
- Events: `pull_request` and `push` to `develop` with path filters for service migrations, service README files, the workflow file, and technology decisions.
- Matrix key: `service`, with one entry for each landed Go service that owns SQL migration files.

### 3. Contracts

- PostgreSQL CI image: `postgres:16-alpine`.
- Goose command: `go run github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@v3.27.1 -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up`.
- Working directory: `services/${{ matrix.service }}`.
- Migration filenames must match ordered snake_case names such as `0001_create_users.sql`.
- SQL migrations must include `-- +goose Up`; `-- +goose Down` is optional only for forward-only slices.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Service has `migrations/*.sql` but no matrix entry | Add the service to migration CI before merging. |
| SQL migration has no `-- +goose Up` annotation | Add the annotation so goose can parse it. |
| Migration filename lacks an ordered prefix | Rename to `0001_<snake_case_summary>.sql` or the next ordered prefix. |
| README goose command version differs from CI | Update both to `v3.27.1`. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `services/auth` migration applies against an empty PostgreSQL database with `goose@v3.27.1`.
- Base: a forward-only migration has `-- +goose Up` and no down section.
- Bad: a service relies only on PostgreSQL Docker init scripts, or README says `goose` without a pinned version.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run migration apply validation for every matrix service or rely on the PR workflow when local PostgreSQL is unavailable.
- Run `git diff --check` before commit.
- Run service-local Go tests when migration files or repository code changed.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```bash
goose -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up
```

Correct:

```bash
go run github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@v3.27.1 -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up
```

---

## Scenario: Local Integration Compose Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, local demo seed
  data, service Dockerfiles, service port mappings, health checks, readiness
  wiring, service tokens, or `.env.example` files for the backend integration
  environment.
- Applies to `deploy/**`, service-local Dockerfiles, migration wiring, and
  documentation that tells frontend or new contributors how to start services.

### 2. Signatures

- Compose entrypoint:
  - `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/.env.example config --quiet`
  - `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/.env.example --profile ai config --quiet`
- Runtime entrypoint:
  - `cd deploy && docker compose up -d --build`
  - `cd deploy && docker compose --profile ai up -d --build`
- Public browser/API entrypoint:
  - `http://localhost:8080` through gateway.
- Operational routes:
  - `GET /healthz`
  - `GET /readyz`

### 3. Contracts

- Frontend and browser-facing documentation must route traffic through gateway;
  internal service ports may be exposed only for local debugging.
- `.env.example` values must be local placeholders and must not contain real
  provider keys, tokens, passwords, or production credentials.
- Compose must include health checks for infrastructure and service containers
  where the image has a practical probe command.
- PostgreSQL health checks used by migration jobs must probe TCP readiness, e.g.
  `pg_isready -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres`; socket-only checks can pass
  during the official image's temporary init server and start migrations before
  port `5432` accepts connections.
- Qdrant health checks must use commands available inside `qdrant/qdrant`; do
  not assume `curl` or `wget` exists. A bash TCP probe such as
  `bash -ec '</dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/6333'` is acceptable when HTTP tooling is absent.
- Service containers must use service-local Dockerfiles and keep each Go service
  independently buildable.
- Go service Dockerfiles should set `GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct` in the
  build stage before `go mod download`, matching the local network fallback used
  by service verification.
- PostgreSQL seed scripts may create local/demo data only after service-owned
  migrations have applied; production seed or secret material does not belong in
  `deploy/seeds`.
- File Service runs with PostgreSQL metadata in the root local Compose baseline,
  so it must receive `FILE_INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` or `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`.
  Callers that may reach File Service without passing through gateway, such as
  Knowledge and Document background workers, must also receive a matching file
  service token and send it as `X-Service-Token`.
- Optional services such as `ai-gateway` may use a Compose profile, but gateway
  base URL configuration should remain explicit so route failures are
  diagnosable.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| Compose YAML or env interpolation is invalid | `docker compose ... config --quiet` must fail before merge. |
| Required Docker image is unavailable locally | Document `docker pull` commands and report Docker runtime validation as skipped. |
| Docker build times out on `proxy.golang.org` | Set the service Dockerfile build-stage `GOPROXY` to `https://goproxy.cn,direct` and rebuild. |
| Migration jobs fail with `connect: connection refused` immediately after PostgreSQL init | Ensure Postgres healthcheck uses `pg_isready -h localhost`, then recreate containers without deleting volumes unless seed state requires it. |
| Qdrant stays `health: starting` while `http://localhost:6333/readyz` works | Inspect Docker health output for missing probe tools and switch to an in-image TCP probe. |
| File calls return `401 unauthorized` while `file /readyz` is healthy | Verify `FILE_INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` on file and matching `KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `DOCUMENT_FILE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, or propagated `X-Service-Token` on callers. |
| Gateway readiness fails | Check Redis and auth first, then search logs by `X-Request-Id`. |
| Auth/document/ai-gateway readiness fails | Inspect PostgreSQL container, migration job, and service logs. |
| Seed data insert fails | Keep scripts idempotent with `ON CONFLICT` and verify migrations ran first. |
| Optional AI Gateway is not running | Core startup may proceed, but QA/model routes should document dependency failure risk. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `deploy/README.md` documents ports, env keys, image pulls, seed data,
  request-id troubleshooting, and common dependency failures; Compose config
  parses for both default and optional profiles.
- Base: Docker runtime smoke tests are skipped when images are missing, but the
  exact image pull commands and skipped validation are reported.
- Bad: frontend documentation points to `http://localhost:8083` for Knowledge,
  `.env.example` contains a real provider API key, a seed script writes data
  before the owning service migration job completes, or File Service runs in DB
  mode without matching service tokens for direct internal callers.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run Compose config parsing for default and optional profiles.
- Run `git diff --check`.
- Run `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/server` for changed Go services or
  every service referenced by the integration baseline when feasible.
- For QA, also run `go build ./cmd/agent` when `services/qa/cmd/agent` exists.
- Run Docker image build/start smoke tests when the required local images are
  available; otherwise document the missing image installation commands.
- Runtime smoke tests must include `docker compose ps` and at least one host
  `/readyz` call for gateway, each core service, Qdrant, and optional
  `ai-gateway` when the `ai` profile is enabled.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
frontend -> http://localhost:8083/internal/v1/knowledge-bases
deploy/.env.example -> real provider API key
document worker -> file /internal/v1/files without X-Service-Token
seed SQL -> inserts model_profiles before ai-gateway migrations
```

#### Correct

```text
frontend -> gateway http://localhost:8080/api/v1/knowledge-bases
deploy/.env.example -> local placeholder secrets only
document worker -> file /internal/v1/files with DOCUMENT_FILE_SERVICE_TOKEN
seed SQL -> idempotent local/demo data after service migrations
```

## Forbidden Patterns

- Root-level Go module used to build all microservices together.
- Cross-service imports from `services/<other-service>/internal/...`.
- HTTP handlers that contain business rules, SQL, Qdrant queries, or MinIO object logic.
- Unbounded goroutines without cancellation.
- HTTP clients without timeouts.
- SQL built by concatenating user input.
- Panics for expected business errors.
- Global mutable state for request-scoped data.
- Logging secrets, tokens, raw credentials, or full sensitive payloads.

---

## Required Patterns

- Pass `context.Context` through request, service, repository, and infrastructure calls.
- Use graceful shutdown for HTTP servers.
- Validate environment configuration at startup.
- Keep service dependencies explicit in constructors.
- Keep business workflows in `internal/service/`.
- Keep persistence in `internal/repository/`.
- Use stable API response shapes: project-owned JSON APIs use
  `{ data, requestId }` / `{ error }`; AI Gateway model invocation success
  responses use OpenAI-compatible shapes as documented in
  `docs/services/ai-gateway/api/openapi.yaml`.
- Add or update tests for changed business logic.

---

## Testing Requirements

Use a risk-based test strategy:

| Change Type | Required Coverage |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Pure functions or validators | Unit tests |
| Service business workflows | Unit tests with mocked repositories/clients |
| Repository SQL changes | Integration tests when database test tooling exists |
| HTTP handlers | Handler tests for status code and response shape |
| Cross-service client changes | Contract-style tests or mocked HTTP server tests |
| Migration changes | Migration validation once tooling exists |

Test naming:

- Use `Test<FunctionOrBehavior>`.
- Prefer table-driven tests for validators, mappers, and policy decisions.
- Test expected errors explicitly with `errors.Is` or `errors.As`.

---

## Configuration Quality

- Read configuration from environment variables in `internal/config` using an
  `envconfig`-style structured loader.
- Validate all required variables at startup.
- Keep defaults safe for local development only.
- Do not read environment variables throughout business logic.
- Document required variables in service README or deployment docs.

---

## Code Review Checklist

Reviewers should check:

- [ ] Does the change stay within the correct service boundary?
- [ ] Are HTTP request and response contracts stable?
- [ ] Are errors classified and returned through the standard error shape?
- [ ] Is sensitive data excluded from logs and responses?
- [ ] Are database changes represented by service-owned migrations?
- [ ] Are Redis/Qdrant/MinIO responsibilities owned by the correct service?
- [ ] Are timeouts and context cancellation handled for external calls?
- [ ] Do tests cover the changed behavior?
- [ ] Can the service still run `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/server` independently?

---

## Common Mistakes

- Adding shared code before three services actually need the same behavior.
- Testing only handlers while business rules remain untested.
- Treating Docker Compose startup as a substitute for service-level tests.
- Allowing the gateway to accumulate all business logic.
