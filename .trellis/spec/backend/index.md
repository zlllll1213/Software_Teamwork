# Backend Development Guidelines

> Engineering rules for Go backend services in the power-industry knowledge management system.

---

## Overview

Backend code is organized as independent Go microservices under `services/`.
Each service owns its own `go.mod`, HTTP API, configuration, tests, Docker
build, and CI job. Services communicate through HTTP/REST in the initial
architecture.

Backend services:

| Service | Path | Responsibility |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Gateway | `services/gateway/` | Public backend entrypoint, routing, request coordination |
| Auth | `services/auth/` | Authentication, authorization, identities, sessions/tokens |
| File | `services/file/` | Uploads, file metadata, MinIO object orchestration |
| QA | `services/qa/` | AI question answering over retrieved knowledge |
| Knowledge | `services/knowledge/` | Knowledge ingestion, indexing, retrieval coordination |
| Document | `services/document/` | Report and document generation workflows |

Infrastructure dependencies:

- PostgreSQL for relational application data.
- Redis for cache, sessions, lightweight queues, or short-lived coordination.
- Qdrant for vector search.
- MinIO for object storage.

## Pre-Development Checklist

Before changing backend code:

- [ ] Identify the affected service under `services/<service>/`.
- [ ] Read [Directory Structure](./directory-structure.md) for service layout rules.
- [ ] Read [Database Guidelines](./database-guidelines.md) if data, cache, vector search, or object storage is touched.
- [ ] Read [Error Handling](./error-handling.md) if handlers, service calls, or client responses are touched.
- [ ] Read [Logging Guidelines](./logging-guidelines.md) before adding logs or changing error logging.
- [ ] Read [Quality Guidelines](./quality-guidelines.md) before declaring implementation complete.
- [ ] Run service-local checks from the service directory, at minimum `go test ./...`.

## Cross-Service Principles

- Keep each service independently buildable and testable.
- Prefer explicit HTTP contracts between services over importing another service's internal Go packages.
- Do not create shared Go libraries casually. Introduce shared packages only when a repeated pattern appears across at least three services and the ownership boundary is clear.
- Keep service-specific configuration in that service; keep deployment wiring in `deploy/`.
- Validate incoming requests at service boundaries and return stable JSON error responses.
